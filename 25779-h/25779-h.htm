<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A DESERT RIDER</h3>
</div>

<p>From out of the shimmering haze that veiled the
mystic eastern space came a big black horse bearing
a rider. Swinging wide, to avoid the feathery dust that
lay at the base of a huge sand dune, the black horse
loped, making no sound, and seeming to glide forward
without effort. Like a somber, gigantic ghost the animal
moved, heroic of mold, embodying the spirit of
the country, seeming to bear the sinister message of
the desert, the whispered promise of death, the lingering
threat, the grim mockery of life, and the conviction
of futility.
</p>
<p>The black horse had come far. The glossy coat of
him was thickly sprinkled with alkali dust, sifted upon
him by the wind of his passage through the desert; his
black muzzle was gray with it; ropes of it matted his
mane, his forelock had become a gray-tinged wisp
which he fretfully tossed; the dust had rimmed his eyes,
causing them to loom large and wild; and as his rider
pulled him to a halt on the western side of the sand
dune&mdash;where both horse and rider would not be visible
on the sky line&mdash;he drew a deep breath, shook
his head vigorously, and blew a thin stream of dust
from his nostrils.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>With head and ears erect, his eyes flaming his undying
courage and his contempt for distance and the
burning heat that the midday sun poured upon him, he
gazed westward, snorting long breaths into his eager
lungs.
</p>
<p>The rider sat motionless upon him&mdash;rigid and alert.
His gaze also went into the west; and he blinked
against the white glare of sun and distance, squinting
his eyes and scanning the featureless waste with appraising
glances.
</p>
<p>In the breathless, dead calm of the desert there was
no sound or movement. On all sides the vast gray
waste stretched, a yawning inferno of dead, dry sand
overhung with a brassy, cloudless sky in which swam
the huge ball of molten silver that for ages had ruled
that baked and shriveled land.
</p>
<p>A score of miles westward&mdash;twoscore, perhaps&mdash;the
shadowy peaks of some mountains loomed upward
into the mystic haze, with purple bases melting into the
horizon; southward were other mountains, equally distant
and mysterious; northward&mdash;so far away that
they blurred in the vision&mdash;were still other mountains.
Intervening on all sides was the stretching, soundless,
aching void of desolation, carrying to the rider its lurking
threat of death, the promise of evil to come.
</p>
<p>The man, however, seemed unperturbed. In his
narrowed, squinting eyes as he watched the desert was
a gleam of comprehension, of knowledge intimate and
sympathetic. They glowed with the serene calm of
confidence; and far back in them lurked a glint of grim
mockery. It was as though they visualized the threatened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
dangers upon which they looked, answering the
threat with contempt.
</p>
<p>The man was tall. His slim waist was girded by a
cartridge belt which was studded with leaden missiles
for the rifle that reposed in the saddle holster, and for
the two heavy pistols that sagged at his hips. A gray
woolen shirt adorned his broad shoulders; a scarlet
neckerchief at his throat which had covered his mouth
as he rode was now drooping on his chest; and the big,
wide-brimmed felt hat he wore was jammed far down
over his forehead. The well-worn leather chaps that
covered his legs could not conceal their sinewy strength,
nor could the gauntleted leather gloves on his hands
hide the capable size of them.
</p>
<p>He was a fixture of this great waste of world in
whose center he sat. He belonged to the country; he
was as much a part of it as the somber mountains, the
sun-baked sand, the dead lava, and the hardy, evil-looking
cacti growth that raised its spined and mocking
green above the arid stretch. He symbolized the spirit
of the country&mdash;from the slicker that bulged at the
cantle of the saddle behind him, to the capable gloved
hands that were now resting on the pommel of the
saddle&mdash;he represented the force which was destined
to conquer the waste places.
</p>
<p>For two days he had been fighting the desert; and
in the serene calm of his eyes was the identical indomitability
that had been in them when he had set forth.
As he peered westward the strong lines around his
mouth relaxed, his lips opened a trifle, and a mirthless
smile wreathed them. He patted the shoulder of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
black horse, and the dead dust ballooned from the
animal&#8217;s coat and floated heavily downward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re about halfway, Purgatory,&#8221; he said aloud,
his voice coming flat and expressionless in the dead,
vacuum-like silence. He did not cease to peer westward
nor to throw sharp glances north and south. He
drew off a glove and pushed his hat back, using a
pocket handkerchief to brush the dust from his face
and running the fingers of the hand through his hair&mdash;thereby
producing another ballooning dust cloud which
splayed heavily downward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s botherin&#8217; me is that shootin&#8217;,&#8221; he went on,
still speaking to the black horse. &#8220;We sure enough
heard it&mdash;didn&#8217;t we?&#8221; He laughed, again patting the
black&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;An&#8217; you heard it first&mdash;as usual&mdash;with
me trailin&#8217; along about half a second behind. But
we sure heard &#8217;em, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The black horse whinnied lowly, whereupon the
rider dismounted, and stretched himself.
</p>
<p>From a water-bag at the cantle of the saddle he
poured water into his big hat, watching sympathetically
while the big horse drank. Some few drops that still
remained in the hat after the horse had finished he
playfully shook on the animal&#8217;s head, smiling widely
at the whinny of delight that greeted the action. He
merely wet his own lips from the water-bag. Then for
an instant, after replacing the bag, he stood at the
black&#8217;s shoulder, his face serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hit the Kelso water-hole about sundown, I
reckon, Purgatory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s certain. There&#8217;s
only one thing can stop us&mdash;that shootin&#8217;. If it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
Apaches, why, I reckon there&#8217;s a long dry spell ahead
of us; but if it&#8217;s only Greasers&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He grinned with grim eloquence, patted the black
again, and climbed into the saddle. Again, as before,
he sat silent upon his mount, scanning the sun-scorched
waste; and then he rode forward.
</p>
<p>An hour later, during which he loped the black horse
slowly, he again drew the animal to a halt and gazed
around him, frowning, his eyes gleaming with a savage
intolerance.
</p>
<p>The shooting he had heard some time previous to
his appearance at the base of the big sand dune had
not been done by Indians. He was almost convinced
of that now. Or, if Indians had done the shooting,
they had not yet observed him. The fact that he had
seen no smoke signals proved that.
</p>
<p>Still, there was the deep silence on every hand to
bring doubt into his mind; and he knew that Indians&mdash;especially
Apaches&mdash;were tricky, sometimes foregoing
the smoke signals to lie in ambush. And very likely&mdash;if
they had seen him coming&mdash;they were doing that
very thing: waiting for him to ride into the trap they
had prepared. He had not been able to locate the
point from which the reports had come. It had seemed
to him that they had come from a point directly westward;
but he could not be sure, for he had seen no
smoke.
</p>
<p>He talked no more to the horse, sitting rigidly in
the saddle, erect, his head bent a little forward, his
chin thrusting, his lips curving with a bitterly savage
snarl. He felt the presence of living things with him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
in the desert; a presentiment had gripped him&mdash;a conviction
that living men were close and hostile.
</p>
<p>Reaching downward, he drew the rifle from the
saddle holster and examined its mechanism. Placing it
across his knee, he drew out his heavy pistols, one after
another, slowly twirling the cylinders. He replaced
the pistols, making sure that the holster flaps were out
of the way so that they would not catch or drag at the
weapons when he wanted to use them&mdash;and with the
rifle resting across his legs near the saddle horn, he
rode slowly forward.
</p>
<p>He swung wide of even the small sand dunes as he
passed them, and he kept a vigilant eye upon the dead
rocks that dotted the level at infrequent intervals.
Even the cactus clumps received flattering attention;
and the little stretches of greasewood that came within
range of his vision were examined closely.
</p>
<p>At the end of half an hour he had seen nothing unusual.
Here and there he had noticed a rattler lurking
in the shade of a rock or partly concealed under the
thorny blade of a sprawling cactus; and he had seen a
sage hen nestling in the hot sand. But these were fixtures&mdash;as
was also the Mexican eagle that winged its
slow way in mile-wide circles in the glaring, heat-pulsing
sky.
</p>
<p>The rider again halted the black horse. The presentiment
of evil had grown upon him, and he twisted
around in the saddle, sweeping the desolate vast level
with cold, alert, puzzled eyes.
</p>
<p>There was no object near him behind which an
enemy might lie concealed; the gray floor of the desert
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
within many hundred miles of him was smooth and flat
and obstructionless. Far away, half a mile, perhaps,
he saw a thrusting knob of rock, with some cactus
fringing it. From where he sat in the saddle it seemed
that the rock might be the peak of a mountain reaching
upward out of the sea of sand and desert waste&mdash;but
it was barren on sides and top, and would afford no
concealment for an enemy, except at its base. And
even the base was not large enough to conceal more
than a few men.
</p>
<p>The rider gazed long at the rock, but could detect no
sign of movement near it. He had turned from it, to
look again into the western distance, when Purgatory
whinnied lowly.
</p>
<p>Flashing around in the saddle, the rider again faced
the rock. And he saw movement there now. The distance
was great, but the clarity of the atmosphere
brought a moving object distinctly into his vision. The
object was a man, and, like a huge fly, he was crawling
rapidly up the sloping side of the rock, toward its
peak, which flattened abruptly at the summit.
</p>
<p>The man bore a rifle. The rider could see it dragging
from the man&#8217;s hand; and in a flash the rider was
out of the saddle, throwing himself flat behind a low
ridge of sand, his own rifle coming to a rest on a small
boulder as he trained its muzzle upon the man, who
by this time had reached the summit of the rocks in
the distance. The rider waited, nursing the stock of
the rifle, his eyes blazing, while Purgatory, seemingly
aware of an impending tragedy, moved slowly away as
though understanding that he must not expose himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>The rider waited, anticipating the bullet that would
presently whine toward him. And then he heard the
report of the man&#8217;s rifle, saw that the smoke streak
had been directed downward, as though the man on the
summit of the rock were shooting at something below
him.
</p>
<p>The rider had been pressing the trigger of his own
weapon when he saw the smoke streak. He withheld
his fire when he divined that the man was not shooting
at him; and when he saw the man on the rock shoot
again&mdash;downward once more&mdash;the rider frowned
with embarrassment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t even know I&#8217;m here!&#8221; he mused. &#8220;An&#8217; me
gettin&#8217; ready to salivate him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got to his knees and watched, curiosity gleaming
in his eyes. He saw the man on the rock fire again&mdash;downward&mdash;and
he noted a smoke spurt answer the
shot, coming upward from the base of the rock. The
rider got to his feet and peered intently at the rock.
And now he saw another man crouching near its base.
This man, however, was not the one the man on the
summit of the rock was shooting at, for smoke streaks
were issuing from a weapon in that man&#8217;s hand also,
but they were horizontal streaks.
</p>
<p>Therefore the rider divined that the two men must
be shooting at another who was on the far side of the
rock; and he ran to Purgatory, speaking no word until
he had vaulted into the saddle. Then he spoke shortly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re white men, Purgatory, an&#8217; they&#8217;re havin&#8217;
a private rukus, looks like. But we&#8217;re doin&#8217; some investigatin&#8217;
just to see if the game&#8217;s on the level.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A MAN&#8217;S REPUTATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Purgatory moved fast, but warily. The black
horse seemed to have caught something of his
rider&#8217;s caution. For part of the distance toward the
rock the animal traveled straight, loping rapidly, but
as he neared the little stretch of broken country that
surrounded the rock he began to sheer off, advancing
with mincing steps, his ears erect, his eyes wide and
alert, snorting suspiciously.
</p>
<p>Knowing his horse, the rider made no attempt to
guide him; he knew Purgatory was alert to any hostile
movement on the part of the men who were shooting,
and that at the first sign of danger to himself or to his
rider he would do what was required of him.
</p>
<p>The man on the summit of the rock was still shooting,
though intermittently. It seemed to the rider that
the man&#8217;s target must be elusive or concealed, for the
shooter&#8217;s actions showed that he was irritated. The
other man, too, was still shooting. The rider noted
that he, too, seemed to be meeting with failure, for as
the rider drew nearer he heard the man curse.
</p>
<p>Neither of the two men who were visible to the rider
had seen him&mdash;neither of them had heard the big
black horse gliding over the deep sand of the desert.
The rider grinned with grim mirthlessness, edging Purgatory
around so that the two men, their backs toward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
him, were not more than twenty or thirty feet away
and entirely exposed to his view.
</p>
<p>So intent were they upon their work that they did
not even hear the rider&#8217;s low laugh as he brought the
big black horse to a halt and sat quietly in the saddle,
a heavy pistol in each hand, watching them.
</p>
<p>The rock, the rider noted, was a huge granite block,
rotted from long exposure to the elements, seamed and
scarred and cracked. The action of the eternally moving
sand had worn an irregular-shaped concave into its
southern wall, so that the summit overhung the side.
The man on the summit was lying flat on his stomach,
leaning far over, still shooting downward. The other
man, who was standing at the base, was flattened
against it, facing the concave side, shooting occasionally,
and cursing volubly.
</p>
<p>The rider was curious. Glancing sidelong, southward,
he saw two horses not more than a hundred
yards away. They were in a depression, behind a sand
ridge, which accounted for the fact that the rider had
not seen them before.
</p>
<p>Sight of the horses brought a widening grin to the
rider&#8217;s face. He had thought, at first, that the two
men were shooting at another man, concealed behind
the rock; but the fact that there were only two horses
indicated that he had been in error. No man would
be foolhardy enough to attempt to cross the desert on
foot, and unless a man were a friend he would not be
carried upon another man&#8217;s horse. Therefore, it
seemed to be evident that the target at which the men
were shooting was not another man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>And now, convinced that the men had cornered an
animal of some kind, and that they feared it too
greatly to face it openly, the rider laughed loudly and
called to the men, his voice freighted with sarcasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Scared?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be. If you&#8217;ll back
off a little an&#8217; give him room, he&#8217;ll just naturally slope,
an&#8217; give you a chance to get to your cayuses.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both men wheeled almost at the same instant. The
man at the base of the rock snarled&mdash;after the first
gasp of astonishment, baring his teeth in hideous mirth
and embarrassment; the other man, startled and caught
off balance at the sound of the rider&#8217;s voice, slipped,
tried to catch himself, failed, and tumbled awkwardly
down, scrambling and cursing, to the sand within a few
feet of the rider.
</p>
<p>Sitting in the sand at the base of the rock, the man
who had fallen also snarled as he sat, looking at the
rider.
</p>
<p>Neither of the two men moved after the involuntary
muscular action that had resulted from their astonishment.
The man at the base of the rock stood
in the position in which he had found himself when
he had wheeled.
</p>
<p>The pistol in his right hand was held close to his
side, the muzzle directed at the rider.
</p>
<p>But a change was coming over the man&#8217;s face. The
color was slowly going out of it, the lips were loosening
as his jaws dropped, his body began to sag, and his
eyes began to widen with fear, stark and naked. At
length, the rider now watching him with a gaze in
which there began to glow recognition and contempt,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the man dropped his hands to his sides and leaned
against the rock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan!&#8221; he muttered hoarsely.
</p>
<p>The rider watched, his eyes glittering coldly, his lips
twisting in a crooked sneer. Amusement was his dominating
emotion, but there was hate in his gaze, mingling
with a malignant joy and triumph. The pistols
in his hands became steady as his wrist muscles stiffened;
and he watched the two men warily, apparently
looking straight at the standing man, but seeing the
sitting man also.
</p>
<p>And now a silence fell&mdash;a strained, premonitory
silence that had in it a hint of imminent tragedy. The
sitting man stiffened, divining the promise of violence;
the standing man shrank back a little and looked downward
at the pistol in his right hand.
</p>
<p>The rider saw the glance and laughed lowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep her right where she is, Dolver,&#8221; he warned.
&#8220;You lift her one little wee lift, an&#8217; I bore you plumb
in the brain-box. Sort of flabbergasted, eh? Didn&#8217;t
expect to run into me again so soon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed as the other cringed, his face dead
white, his eyes fixed on the rider with a sort of dread
fascination.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolver, didn&#8217;t you know when you got my little
partner, Davey Langan, that I&#8217;d be comin&#8217; for you?&#8221;
said the rider in a slow, drawling whisper. &#8220;In the
back you got him, not givin&#8217; him a chance. You&#8217;re
gettin&#8217; yours now. I&#8217;m givin&#8217; you a chance to take it
like a man&mdash;standin&#8217;, with your face to me. Lift her
now&mdash;damn you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>There was no change in his expression as he watched
the man he had called Dolver. There came no change
in the cold, steady gleam of his eyes as he saw the man
stiffen and swing the muzzle of his pistol upward with
a quick, jerky motion. But he sneered as with the
movement he sent a bullet into the man&#8217;s chest; his
lips curving with slight irony when Dolver&#8217;s gun went
off, the bullet throwing up sand at Purgatory&#8217;s forehoofs.
</p>
<p>His eyes grew hard as he saw Dolver stagger, drop
his pistol, and clutch at his chest; and he watched with
seeming indifference as the man slowly sank to his
knees and stretched out, face down, in the dust at the
base of the rock.
</p>
<p>His lips were stiff with bitter rage, however, as he
faced the other man, who had not moved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up on your hind legs, you yellow coyote!&#8221; he
commanded.
</p>
<p>For an instant it seemed that the other man was to
share the fate of the first. The man seemed to think
so, too, for he got up trembling, his hands outstretched
along the rock, the fingers outspread and twitching
from the paralysis of fear that had seized him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot your gab off quick!&#8221; commanded the rider.
&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Laskar,&#8221; the man muttered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you from?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lamo.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rider&#8217;s eyes quickened. &#8220;Where did you meet
up with that scum?&#8221; He indicated Dolver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In town.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lamo?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long ago?&#8221; asked the rider.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Bout a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s voice was hoarse; he seemed reluctant to
talk more, and he cast furtive, dreading glances toward
the base of the rock where Dolver had stood before
the rider had surprised the men.
</p>
<p>Watching the man narrowly, the rider noted his
nervous glance, and his shrinking, dreading manner.
Harlan&#8217;s eyes gleamed with suspicion, and in a flash
he was off the black and standing before Laskar, forbidding
and menacing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take off your gun-belt an&#8217; chuck it under my
horse!&#8221; he directed sharply. &#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217;
goin&#8217; on here that ain&#8217;t been mentioned. I&#8217;m findin&#8217;
out what it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He watched while the man unbuckled his cartridge
belt and threw it&mdash;the pistol still in the holster&mdash;into
the sand at Purgatory&#8217;s hoofs. Then he stepped to the
man, sheathed one of his pistols, and ran the free hand
over the other&#8217;s clothing in search of other weapons.
Finding none, he stooped and took up Dolver&#8217;s pistol
and rifle that had fallen from the man&#8217;s hands when he
had tumbled off the rock, throwing them near where
the cartridge belt had fallen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You freeze there while I take a look around this
rock!&#8221; he commanded, with a cold look at the man.
</p>
<p>Half a dozen steps took him around the base of the
rock. He went boldly, though his muscles were tensed
and his eyes alert for surprises. But he had not taken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
a dozen steps in all when he halted and stiffened, his
lips setting into straight, hard lines.
</p>
<p>For, stretched out on his left side in the sand close
to the base of the rock&mdash;under the flattened summit
which had afforded him protection from the bullets the
man with the rifle had been sending at him&mdash;was a
man.
</p>
<p>The man was apparently about fifty, with a seamed,
pain-lined face. His beard was stained with dust, his
hair was gray with it; his clothing looked as though
he had been dragged through it. He was hatless, and
one of his boots was off. The foot had been bandaged
with a handkerchief, and through the handkerchief
the dark stains of a wound appeared.
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s shirt was open in front; and the rider
saw that another wound gaped in his chest, near the
heart. The man had evidently made some attempt to
care for that wound, too, for a piece of cloth from his
shirt had been cut away, to permit him to get at the
wound easily.
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s left side seemed to be helpless, for the
arm was twisted queerly, the palm of the hand turned
limply upward; but when the rider came upon him the
man was trying to tuck a folded paper into one of the
cylinders of a pistol.
</p>
<p>He had laid the weapon in the sand, and with his
right hand was working with the cylinder and the
paper. When he saw the rider he sneered and ceased
working with the pistol, looking up into the rider&#8217;s
face, his eyes glowing with defiance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance for that even, eh?&#8221; he said, glancing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
at the paper and the pistol. &#8220;Things is goin&#8217; plumb
wrong!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sagged back, resting his weight on the right elbow,
and looked steadily at the rider&mdash;the look of a
wounded animal defying his pursuers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get goin&#8217;!&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;Do your damnedest! I
heard that sneak, Dolver, yappin&#8217; to you. You&#8217;re
&#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan&mdash;gun-fighter, outlaw, killer! I&#8217;ve
heard of you,&#8221; he went on as he saw Harlan scowl
and stiffen. &#8220;Your reputation has got all over. I
reckon you&#8217;re in the game to salivate me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan sheathed his gun.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talkin&#8217; extravagant, mister man.&#8221; And now
he permitted a cold smile to wreathe his lips. &#8220;If it&#8217;ll
do you any good to know,&#8221; he added, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just put
Dolver out of business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard that, too,&#8221; declared the man, laughing bitterly.
&#8220;I heard you tellin&#8217; Dolver. He killed your
partner&mdash;or somethin&#8217;. That&#8217;s personal, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t
interested. Get goin&#8217;&mdash;the sooner the better. If
you&#8217;d hand it to me right now, I&#8217;d be much obliged to
you; for I&#8217;m goin&#8217; fast. This hole in my chest&mdash;which
I got last night while I was sleepin&#8217;&mdash;will do
the business without any help from you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After a pause for breath, the man began to speak
again, railing at his would-be murderers. He was
talking ramblingly when there came a sound from the
opposite side of the rock&mdash;a grunt, a curse, and,
almost instantly, a shriek.
</p>
<p>The wounded man raised himself and threw a glance
of startled inquiry at Harlan: &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Harlan watched the man steadily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;ll be that man Laskar,&#8221; he said
slowly. &#8220;I lifted his gun an&#8217; his rifle, an&#8217; Dolver&#8217;s
gun, an&#8217; throwed them under Purgatory&mdash;my horse.
Laskar has tried to get them, an&#8217; Purgatory&#8217;s raised
some objection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stepped back and peered around the rock.
Laskar was lying in the sand near the base of the
rock, doubled up and groaning loudly, while Purgatory,
his nostrils distended, his eyes ablaze, was standing
over the weapons that lay in the sand, watching
the groaning man malignantly.
</p>
<p>Harlan returned to the wounded man, to find that
he had collapsed and was breathing heavily.
</p>
<p>For some minutes Harlan stood, looking down at
him; then he knelt in the sand beside him and lifted
his head. The man&#8217;s eyes were closed, and Harlan
laid his head down again and examined the wound in
his chest.
</p>
<p>He shook his head as he got up, went to Purgatory,
and got some water, which he used to wipe away the
dust and blood which had become matted over the
wound. He shook his head again after bathing the
wound. The wound meant death for the man within
a short time. Yet Harlan forced some water into the
half-open mouth and bathed the man&#8217;s face with it.
</p>
<p>For a long time after Harlan ceased to work with
him the man lay in a stupor-like silence, limp and
motionless, though his eyes opened occasionally, and
by the light in them Harlan knew the man was aware
of what he had been doing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>The sun was going now; it had become a golden,
blazing ball which was sinking over the peaks of some
distant mountains, its fiery rays stabbing the pale azure
of the sky with brilliantly glowing shafts that threw off
ever-changing seas of color that blended together in
perfect harmony.
</p>
<p>Harlan alternately watched the wounded man and
Laskar.
</p>
<p>Laskar was still groaning, and finally Harlan
walked to him and pushed him with a contemptuous
foot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, you sneak!&#8221; he ordered. And Laskar,
groaning, holding his chest&mdash;where Purgatory&#8217;s hoofs
had struck him&mdash;staggered to his feet and looked
with piteously pleading eyes at the big man who stood
near him, unmoved by the spectacle of suffering he
presented.
</p>
<p>And when he found that Harlan gave him no sympathy,
he cursed horribly. This drew a cold threat
from Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut your rank mouth or I&#8217;ll turn Purgatory loose
on you&mdash;again. Lookin&#8217; for sympathy, eh? How
much sympathy did you give that hombre who&#8217;s cashin&#8217;
in behind the rocks? None&mdash;damn you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the first flash of feeling Harlan had exhibited,
and Laskar shrank from him in terror.
</p>
<p>But Harlan followed him, grasping him by a shoulder
and gripping it with iron fingers, so that Laskar
screamed with pain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is that man?&#8221; Harlan motioned toward the
rock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lane Morgan. He owns the Rancho Seco&mdash;about
forty miles south of Lamo,&#8221; returned Laskar
after a long look into Harlan&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who set you guys onto him&mdash;what you wantin&#8217;
him for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; whined Laskar. &#8220;Day before yesterday
Dolver an&#8217; me meets up in Lamo, an&#8217; Dolver
asks me to help him give Morgan his pass-out checks
on the ride over to Pardo&mdash;which Morgan&#8217;s intendin&#8217;
to make. I ain&#8217;t got any love for Morgan, an&#8217; so I
took Dolver up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s fingers were sinking into Laskar&#8217;s shoulder
again, and once more the man screamed with pain and
impotent fury.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear&mdash;&#8221; began Laskar.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s grin was bitterly contemptuous. He placed
the other hand on Laskar&#8217;s shoulder and forced the
man to look into his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar, but I&#8217;m lettin&#8217; you off. You&#8217;re a
sneak with Greaser blood in you. I don&#8217;t ever want to
see you again. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to Lamo&mdash;soon as this man
Morgan cashes in. I&#8217;ll be there some time tomorrow.
Lamo wouldn&#8217;t please me none if I was to find you
there when I ride in. You slope, now&mdash;an&#8217; keep on
hittin&#8217; the breeze until there ain&#8217;t no more of it. I&#8217;d
blow you apart if this man Morgan was anything to
me. But it ain&#8217;t my game unless I see you again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He watched until Laskar, still holding his chest,
walked to where the two horses were concealed, and
mounted one of them. When Laskar, leaning over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
the pommel of the saddle, had grown dim in the haze
that was settling over the desert, Harlan scowled and
returned to the wounded man.
</p>
<p>To his astonishment, Morgan was conscious&mdash;and
a cold calmness seemed to have come over him. His
eyes were filled with a light that told of complete
knowledge and resignation. He half smiled as Harlan
knelt beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m about due, I reckon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I heard you
talkin&#8217; to the man you just let get away. It don&#8217;t
make any difference&mdash;about <i>him</i>. I reckon he was
just a tool, anyway. There&#8217;s someone behind this
bigger than Dolver an&#8217; that man Laskar. He didn&#8217;t
tell you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan shook his head negatively, watching the
other intently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t reckon he would,&#8221; said Morgan. &#8220;But
there&#8217;s <i>somebody</i>.&#8221; He gazed long into Harlan&#8217;s face,
and the latter gazed steadily back at him. He seemed
to be searching Harlan&#8217;s face for signs of character.
</p>
<p>Harlan stood the probing glance well&mdash;so that at
last Morgan smiled, saying slowly: &#8220;It&#8217;s funny&mdash;damned
funny. About faces, I mean. Your reputation&mdash;it&#8217;s
bad. I&#8217;ve been hearin&#8217; about you for a
couple of years now. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve been lookin&#8217; at you an&#8217;
tryin&#8217; to make myself say, &#8216;Yes, he&#8217;s the kind of a
guy which would do the things they say he&#8217;s done.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make myself say it; I can&#8217;t even make myself
think it. Either you&#8217;re a mighty good actor, or
you&#8217;re the worst-judged man I ever met. Which
is it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly all of us get reputations we don&#8217;t deserve,&#8221;
said Harlan lowly.
</p>
<p>Morgan&#8217;s eyes gleamed with satisfaction. &#8220;Meanin&#8217;
that you don&#8217;t deserve yours?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s been a heap of lyin&#8217; goin&#8217; on about
me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a long time Morgan watched the other, studying
him. The long twilight of the desert descended
and found them&mdash;Morgan staring at Harlan; the latter
enduring the gaze&mdash;for he knew that the end
would not long be delayed.
</p>
<p>At last Morgan sighed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to take a chance on you.
An&#8217;, somehow, it seems to me that I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; much
of a chance, either. For a man that&#8217;s supposed to be
the hell-raisin&#8217; outlaw that folks say you are, you&#8217;ve
got the straightest eyes I ever seen. I&#8217;ve seen killers&mdash;an&#8217;
outlaws, an&#8217; gun-fighters, an&#8217; I never seen one
that could look at a man like you&#8217;ve looked at me.
Harlan,&#8221; he went on slowly, &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to tell you
about some gold I&#8217;ve hid&mdash;a hundred thousand
dollars!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Keenly, suspicion lurking deep in his eyes, his mouth
half open, seemingly ready to snap shut the instant he
detected greed or cupidity in Harlan&#8217;s eyes, he watched
the latter.
</p>
<p>It seemed that he expected Harlan to betray a lust
for the gold he had mentioned; and he was ready to
close his lips and to die with his secret. And when he
saw that apparently Harlan was unmoved, that he
betrayed, seemingly, not the slightest interest, that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
even his eyelids did not flicker at his words, nor his
face change color&mdash;Morgan drew a tremulous sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me guessin&#8217;,&#8221; he confessed weakly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;re a devil or a saint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t claimin&#8217; nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said Harlan. &#8220;An&#8217; I
ain&#8217;t carin&#8217; a damn about your gold. I&#8217;d a heap rather
you wouldn&#8217;t mention it. More than one man has
busted his character chasin&#8217; that rainbow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t interested?&#8221; demanded Morgan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not none.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morgan&#8217;s eyes glowed with an eager light. For
now that Harlan betrayed lack of interest, Morgan
was convinced&mdash;almost&mdash;that the man&#8217;s reputation
for committing evil deeds had been exaggerated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be interested,&#8221; he declared, lifting
himself on his good arm and leaning toward Harlan.
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t the gold that is botherin&#8217; me so much, anyway&mdash;it&#8217;s
my daughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all my own fault, too,&#8221; he went on when he
saw Harlan&#8217;s eyes quicken. &#8220;I&#8217;ve felt all along that
somethin&#8217; was wrong, but I didn&#8217;t have sense enough
to look into it. An&#8217; now, trustin&#8217; folks so much, an&#8217;
not payin&#8217; strict attention to what was goin&#8217; on
around me, I&#8217;ve got to the point where I&#8217;ve got to
put everything into the hands of a man I never saw
before&mdash;an outlaw.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t nobody crowdin&#8217; you to put anything
into his hands,&#8221; sneered Harlan. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t a heap
anxious to go around buttin&#8217; into trouble for you.
Keep your yap shut, an&#8217; die like a man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morgan laughed, almost triumphantly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
my dyin&#8217; like a man, all right&mdash;don&#8217;t be afraid of
that. You want to hear what I&#8217;ve got to tell you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to listen. Shoot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a gang of outlaws operatin&#8217; in the Lamo
country. Luke Deveny is the chief. It&#8217;s generally
known that Deveny&#8217;s the boss, but he keeps his tracks
pretty well covered, an&#8217; Sheriff Gage ain&#8217;t been able
to get anything on him. Likely Gage is scared of
him, anyway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, Gage don&#8217;t do nothin&#8217;. Deveny&#8217;s a bad
man with a gun; there ain&#8217;t his equal in the Territory.
He&#8217;s got a fellow that runs with him&mdash;Strom Rogers&mdash;who&#8217;s
almost as good as he is with a gun. They&#8217;re
holy terrors; they&#8217;ve got the cattlemen for two hundred
miles around eatin&#8217; out of their hands. They&#8217;re
roarin&#8217;, rippin&#8217; devils!
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no man knows how big their gang is&mdash;seems
like half the people in the Lamo country
must belong to it. There&#8217;s spies all around; there
ain&#8217;t a thing done that the outlaws don&#8217;t seem to
know of it. They drive stock off right in front of
the eyes of the owners; they rob the banks in the
country; they drink an&#8217; kill an&#8217; riot without anyone
interferin&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t anyone knows where their hang-out
is&mdash;no one seems to know anything about them, except
that they&#8217;re on hand when there&#8217;s any devilment
to be done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to talk fast, for I ain&#8217;t got long. I&#8217;ve
never had any trouble with Deveny or Rogers, or any
of the rest of them, because I&#8217;ve always tended to my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
own business. I&#8217;ve seen the thing gettin&#8217; worse an&#8217;
worse, though; an&#8217; I ought to have got out of there
when I had a chance. Lately there ain&#8217;t been no
chance. They watch me like a hawk. I can&#8217;t trust
my men. The Rancho Seco is a mighty big place, an&#8217;
I&#8217;ve got thirty men workin&#8217; for me. But I can&#8217;t trust
a damned one of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About a year ago I found some gold in the Cisco
Mountains near the ranch. It was nugget gold&mdash;only
a pocket. I packed it home, lettin&#8217; nobody see
me doin&#8217; it; an&#8217; I got it all hid in the house, except
the last batch, before anybody knowed anything about
it. Then, comin&#8217; home with the last of it, the damned
bottom had to bust out of the bag right near the corral
gate, where Meeder Lawson, my foreman, was
standin&#8217; watchin&#8217; me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It turned out that he&#8217;d been watchin&#8217; me for a
long time. I never liked the cuss, but he&#8217;s a good
cowman, an&#8217; I had to hold onto him. When he saw
the gold droppin&#8217; out an&#8217; hittin&#8217; the ground like big
hailstones, he grinned that chessie-cat grin he&#8217;s got,
an&#8217; wanted to know if I was through totin&#8217; it home.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to know how he knowed there was more
of it, an&#8217; he said he&#8217;d been keepin&#8217; an eye on me,
an&#8217; knowed there was a heap more of it somewhere
around.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fired him on the spot. There&#8217;d have been gunplay,
but I got the drop on him an&#8217; he had to slope.
Well, the next mornin&#8217; Luke Deveny rode up to where
I was saddlin&#8217;, an&#8217; told me I&#8217;d have to take Lawson
back.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I done so, for I knowed there&#8217;d be trouble with
the outlaws if I didn&#8217;t. I ain&#8217;t never been able to
get any of that gold to the assayer. They&#8217;ve been
watchin&#8217; me like buzzards on a limb over some carrion.
I don&#8217;t get out of their sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now they&#8217;ve finally got me. I&#8217;ve got a little
of the gold in my pocket now&mdash;here it is.&#8221; He drew
out a small buckskin bag and passed it to Harlan,
who took it and held it loosely in his hands, not taking
his gaze from Morgan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a-goin&#8217;,&#8221; suggested Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Interested, eh?&#8221; grinned Morgan; &#8220;I knowed
you&#8217;d be. Well, here I am&mdash;I didn&#8217;t get to the assay
office at Pardo; an&#8217; I&#8217;ll never get there now.&#8221; He
paused and then went on:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now they&#8217;re after Barbara, my daughter. Deveny&mdash;an&#8217;
Strom Rogers, an&#8217; some more&mdash;all of
them, I reckon. I ought to have got out long ago.
But it&#8217;s too late now, I reckon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That damned Deveny&mdash;he&#8217;s a wolf with women.
Handsome as hell, with ways that take with most any
woman that meets him. An&#8217; he&#8217;s as smooth an&#8217; cold
an&#8217; heartless as the devil himself. He ain&#8217;t got no
pity for nobody or nothin&#8217;. An&#8217; Strom Rogers runs
him a close second. An&#8217; there&#8217;s more of them almost
as bad.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They watch every trail that runs from the Rancho
Seco to&mdash;to anywhere. If I ride north there&#8217;s someone
watchin&#8217; me. If I ride south there&#8217;s a man on
my trail. If I go east or west I run into a man or
two who&#8217;s takin&#8217; interest in me. When I go to Lamo,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
there&#8217;ll be half a dozen men strike town about the
same time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t prove they are Deveny&#8217;s men&mdash;but I
know it, for they&#8217;re always around. An&#8217; it&#8217;s the same
way with Barbara&mdash;she can&#8217;t go anywhere without
Deveny, or Rogers&mdash;or some of them&mdash;ain&#8217;t trailin&#8217;
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As I said, the sheriff can&#8217;t do anything&mdash;or he
won&#8217;t. He looks worried when I meet him, an&#8217; gets
out of my way, for fear I&#8217;ll ask him to do somethin&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it stands. An&#8217; now Barbara will
have to play it a lone hand against them. Bill Morgan&mdash;that&#8217;s
my son&mdash;ain&#8217;t home. He&#8217;s gallivantin&#8217;
around the country, doin&#8217; some secret work for the
governor. Somethin&#8217; about rustlers an&#8217; outlaws. He
ought to be home now, to protect Barbara. But instead
he&#8217;s wastin&#8217; his time somewheres else when he
ought to be here&mdash;in Lamo&mdash;where&#8217;s there&#8217;s plenty
of the kind of guys he&#8217;s lookin&#8217; for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one man in the country I trust. He&#8217;s
John Haydon, of the Star ranch&mdash;about fifteen miles
west of the Rancho Seco. Seems to me that Haydon&#8217;s
square. He&#8217;s an upstandin&#8217; man of about thirty, an&#8217;
he&#8217;s dead stuck on Barbara. Seems to me that if it
wasn&#8217;t for Haydon, Deveny, or Lawson, or Rogers,
or some of them scum would have run off with Barbara
long ago.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see how she shapes up?&#8221; he queried as he
watched Harlan&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks bad for Barbara,&#8221; said Harlan slowly.
</p>
<p>Morgan writhed and was silent for a time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Harlan,&#8221; he finally said; &#8220;you&#8217;re considered
to be a hell-raiser yourself, but I can see in
your eyes that you ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; advantage of women.
An&#8217; Harlan&#8221;&mdash;Morgan&#8217;s voice quavered&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s
my little Barbara all alone to take care of herself
with that gang of wolves around. I&#8217;m wantin&#8217; you to
go to the Rancho Seco an&#8217; look around. My wife
died last year. There&#8217;s mebbe two or three guys
around the ranch would stick to Barbara, but that&#8217;s
all. Take a look at John Haydon, an&#8217; if you think
he&#8217;s on the level&mdash;an&#8217; you want to drift on&mdash;turn
things over to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morgan shuddered, and was silent for a time, his
lips tight-shut, his face whitening in the dusk as he
fought the pain that racked him. When he at last
spoke again his voice was so weak that Harlan had
to kneel and lean close to him to hear the low-spoken
words that issued from between his quavering lips:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan&mdash;you&#8217;re white; you&#8217;ve got to be white&mdash;to
Barbara! That paper I was tryin&#8217; to stuff into my
gun&mdash;when you come around the rock. You take it.
It&#8217;ll tell you where the gold is. You&#8217;ll find my will&mdash;in
my desk in my office&mdash;off the <i>patio</i>. Everything
goes to Barbara. Everybody knows that. Haydon
knows it&mdash;Deveny&#8217;s found it out. You can&#8217;t get
me back&mdash;it&#8217;s too far. Plant me here&mdash;an&#8217; tell
Barbara.&#8221; He laughed hollowly. &#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s
all.&#8221; He felt for one of Harlan&#8217;s hands, found it,
and gripped it with all his remaining strength. His
voice was hoarse, quavering:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t refuse, Harlan? You can&#8217;t refuse!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Why, my little Barbara will be all alone, man! What
a damned fool I&#8217;ve been not to look out for her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Night had come, and Morgan could not see Harlan&#8217;s
face. But he was conscious of the firm grip of
Harlan&#8217;s hands, and he laughed lowly and thankfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do it&mdash;for Barbara&mdash;won&#8217;t you? Say
you will, man! Let me hear you say it&mdash;now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m givin&#8217; you my word,&#8221; returned Harlan slowly.
And now he leaned still closer to the dying man and
whispered long to him.
</p>
<p>When he concluded Morgan fought hard to raise
himself to a sitting posture; he strained, dragging
himself in the sand in an effort to see Harlan&#8217;s face.
But the black desert night had settled over them, and
all Morgan could see of Harlan was the dim outlines
of his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it again, man! Say it again, an&#8217; light a match
so&#8217;s I can see you while you&#8217;re sayin&#8217; it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause. Then a match flared its light
revealing Harlan&#8217;s face, set in serious lines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t lie to you&mdash;now&mdash;Morgan,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to the Lamo country to bust up Deveny&#8217;s
gang.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Morgan stared hard at the other while the flickering
light lasted with a strained intensity that transfigured
his face, suffusing it with a glow that could
not have been more eloquent with happiness had the
supreme Master of the universe drawn back the mysterious
veil of life to permit him to look upon the great
secret.
</p>
<p>When the match flickered and went out, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
darkness of the desert reigned again, Morgan sank
back with a tremulous, satisfied sigh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; now,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217;&mdash;knowin&#8217;
God has been good to me.&#8221; He breathed fast, gaspingly.
And for a moment he spoke hurriedly, as
though fearful he would not be given time to say
what he wanted to say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone plugged me&mdash;last night while I was
sleepin&#8217;. Shot me in the chest&mdash;here. Didn&#8217;t give
me no chance. There was three of them. My fire had
gone out an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t see their faces. Likely Laskar
an&#8217; Dolver was two. The other one must have
sloped. It was him shot me. Tried to knife me, too;
but I fought him, an&#8217; he broke away. It happened
behind a rock&mdash;off to the left&mdash;a red boulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I grabbed at him an&#8217; caught somethin&#8217;. What it
was busted. I couldn&#8217;t wait to find out what it was.
I&#8217;m hopin&#8217; it&#8217;s somethin&#8217; that&#8217;ll help you to find out
who the man was. I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be mean&mdash;just
when I&#8217;m dyin&#8217;; but if you was to look for that
thing, find it, an&#8217; could tell who the man is, mebbe
some day you&#8217;d find it agreeable to pay him for what
he done to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He became silent; no sound except his fast, labored
breathing broke the dead calm of the desert night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somethin&#8217; more than the gold an&#8217; Barbara back
of it all,&#8221; he muttered thickly, seeming to lapse into
a state of semiconsciousness in which the burden that
was upon his mind took the form of involuntary
speech: &#8220;Somethin&#8217; big back of it&mdash;somethin&#8217; they
ain&#8217;t sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; about. But Harlan&mdash;he&#8217;ll take
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
care of&mdash;&#8221; He paused; then his voice leaped. &#8220;Why,
there&#8217;s Barbara now! Why, honey, I thought&mdash;I&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>His voice broke, trailing off into incoherence.
</p>
<p>After a while Harlan rose to his feet. An hour later
he found the red rock Morgan had spoken of&mdash;and
with a flaming bunch of mesquite in hand he searched
the vicinity.
</p>
<p>In a little depression caused by the heel of a boot
he came upon a glittering object, which he examined in
the light of the flaming mesquite, which he had thrown
into the sand after picking up the glittering object.
Kneeling beside the dying flame he discovered that the
glittering trifle he had found was a two- or three-inch
section of gold watch chain of peculiar pattern. He
tucked it into a pocket of his trousers.
</p>
<p>Later, he mounted Purgatory and fled into the appalling
blackness, heading westward&mdash;the big black
horse loping easily.
</p>
<p>The first streaks of dawn found Purgatory drinking
deeply from the green-streaked moisture of Kelso&#8217;s
water-hole. And when the sun stuck a glowing rim
over the desert&#8217;s horizon, to resume his rule over the
baked and blighted land, the big black horse and his
rider were traveling steadily, the only life visible in
the wide area of desolation&mdash;a moving blot, an atom
behind which was death and the eternal, whispered
promise of death.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A GIRL WAITS</h3>
</div>

<p>Lamo, sprawling on a sun-baked plain perhaps a
mile from the edge of the desert, was one of
those towns which owed its existence to the instinct of
men to foregather. It also was indebted for its existence
to the greed of a certain swarthy-faced saloon-keeper
named Joel Ladron, who, anticipating the edict
of a certain town marshal of another town that shall
not be mentioned, had piled his effects into a prairie
schooner&mdash;building and goods&mdash;and had taken the
south trail&mdash;which would lead him wherever he
wanted to stop.
</p>
<p>It had chanced that he had stopped at the present
site of Lamo. Ladron saw a trail winding over the
desert, vanishing into the eastern distance; and he
knew that where trails led there were sure to be thirsty
men who would be eager to look upon his wares.
</p>
<p>Ladron&#8217;s history is not interesting. As time fled to
the monotonous clink of coins over the bar he set up
in the frame shack that faced the desert trail, Ladron&#8217;s
importance in Lamo was divided by six.
</p>
<p>The other dispensers had not come together; they
had appeared as the needs of the population seemed
to demand&mdash;and all had flourished.
</p>
<p>Lamo&#8217;s other buildings had appeared without ostentation.
There were twenty of them. A dozen of the
twenty, for one reason or another, need receive no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
further mention. Of the remaining few, one was occupied
by Sheriff Gage; two others by stores; one answered
as an office and storage-room for the stage
company; and still another was distinguished by a
crude sign which ran across its weather-beaten front,
bearing the legend: &#8220;Lamo Eating-House.&#8221; The
others were private residences.
</p>
<p>Lamo&#8217;s buildings made some pretense of aping
the architecture of buildings in other towns. The eating-house
was a two-story structure, with an outside
stairway leading to its upper floor. It had a flat roof
and an adobe chimney. Its second floor had been subdivided
into lodging-rooms. Its windows were small,
grimy.
</p>
<p>Not one of Lamo&#8217;s buildings knew paint. The
structures, garish husks of squalor, befouled the calm,
pure atmosphere, and mocked the serene majesty of
nature.
</p>
<p>For, beginning at the edge of &#8220;town,&#8221; a contrast to
the desert was presented by nature. It was a mere
step, figuratively, from that land from which came the
whisper of death, to a wild, virgin section where the
hills, the green-brown ridges, the wide sweeps of plain,
and the cool shadows of timber clumps breathed of the
promise, the existence, of life.
</p>
<p>To Barbara Morgan, seated at one of the east windows
of the Lamo Eating-House&mdash;in the second
story, where she could look far out into the desert&mdash;the
contrast between the vivid color westward and the
dun and dead flatness eastward, was startling. For
she knew her father had entered the desert on his way
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
to Pardo, on some business he had not mentioned;
and the whispered threat that the desert carried was
borne to her ears as she watched.
</p>
<p>On a morning, two days before, Morgan had left
the Rancho Seco for Pardo. The girl had watched
him go with a feeling&mdash;almost a conviction&mdash;that
she should have kept him at home. She had not mentioned
to him that she had a presentiment of evil, for
she assured herself that she should have outgrown
those puerile impulses of the senses. And yet, having
watched him depart, she passed a sleepless night, and
early the next morning had saddled her horse to ride to
Lamo, there to await her father&#8217;s return.
</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when she reached
Lamo; and she had gone directly to the Eating-House,
where she had passed another restless night&mdash;spending
most of her time sitting at the window, where she
was at this minute.
</p>
<p>Of course it was a three-day trip to Pardo, and she
had no reason to expect Morgan to return until the end
of the sixth day, at the very earliest. And yet some
force sent her to the window at frequent intervals,
where she would sit, as now, her chin resting in her
hands, her eyes searching the vast waste land with an
anxious light.
</p>
<p>An attaché of the Eating-House had put her horse
away&mdash;where, she did not know; and her meals had
been brought to her by a middle-aged slattern, whose
probing, suspicion-laden glances had been full of mocking
significance. She had heard the woman speak of
her to other female employees of the place&mdash;and once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
she had overheard the woman refer to her as &#8220;that
stuck-up Morgan heifer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Their coarse laughter and coarser language had disgusted
the girl, and she had avoided them all as much
as possible.
</p>
<p>It was the first time she had remained overnight in
the Eating-House lodging-rooms, though she had seen
the building many times during her visits to Lamo. It
wasn&#8217;t what she was accustomed to at the Rancho Seco,
nor was it all that a lodging-house might be&mdash;but it
provided shelter for her while she waited.
</p>
<p>The girl felt&mdash;as she looked&mdash;decidedly out of
place in the shabby room. Many times during her vigil
she had shuddered when looking at the dirty, threadbare
ingrain carpet on the floor of the room; oftener,
when her gaze went to the one picture that adorned
the unpapered walls, she shrank back, her soul filled
with repugnance.
</p>
<p>Art, as here represented, was a cheap lithograph in
vivid colors, of an Indian&mdash;an Apache, judging from
his trappings&mdash;scalping a white man. In the foreground,
beside the man, was a woman, her hair disheveled,
wild appeal in her eyes, gazing at the Indian,
who was grinning at her.
</p>
<p>A cheap bureau, unadorned, with a broken mirror
swinging in a rickety frame; one chair, and the bed in
which she had tried to sleep, were the only articles of
furniture in the room.
</p>
<p>The girl, arrayed in a neat riding habit; her hair
arranged in graceful coils; her slender, lissom figure
denoting youth and vigor; the clear, smooth skin of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
her face&mdash;slightly tanned&mdash;indicating health&mdash;was
as foreign to her present surroundings as life is foreign
to the desert. In her direct eyes was the glow of
sturdy honesty that had instantly antagonized the slattern
who had attended her.
</p>
<p>That glow was not so pronounced now&mdash;it was
dulled by anxiety as she looked out of the window,
watching the desert light fade as twilight came, blotting
the hot sand from her sight, erasing the straight,
unfeatured horizon, and creating a black void which
pulsed with mystery.
</p>
<p>She sighed when at last she could no longer penetrate
the wall of darkness; got up and moved her
chair to one of the front windows, from where she
could look down into Lamo&#8217;s one street.
</p>
<p>Lamo&#8217;s lights began to flicker; from the town&#8217;s
buildings sounds began to issue&mdash;multisonous, carrying
the message of ribaldry unrestrained.
</p>
<p>From a point not very far away came the hideous
screeching of a fiddle, accompanied by a discordant,
monotonous wail, as of someone singing a song unfamiliar
to him; from across the street floated a medley
of other noises, above which could be heard the
jangling music of a heavily drummed piano. There
came to her ears coarse oaths and the maudlin laughter
of women.
</p>
<p>She had heard it all the night before; but tonight
it seemed that something had been added to the volume
of it. And as on the night before, she sat at the window,
watching&mdash;for it was all new and strange to
her&mdash;even if unattractive. But at last the horror of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
it again seized her, and she closed the window, determined
to endure the increased heat.
</p>
<p>Half an hour later, lying, fully dressed, on the bed,
she heard a voice in the hallway beyond the closed
door of her room&mdash;a man&#8217;s voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t what one might call elegant,&#8221; said the voice;
&#8220;but if it&#8217;s the best you&#8217;ve got&mdash;why, of course, it
will have to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl sat straight up in bed, breathless, her face
paling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Luke Deveny!&#8221; she gasped in a suffocating
whisper.
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s voice was answered by a woman&#8217;s&mdash;low,
mirthful. The girl in the room could not distinguish
the words. But the man spoke again&mdash;in a whisper
which carried through the thin board partition to the
girl:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara Morgan is in there&mdash;eh?&#8221; he said and
the girl could almost see him nodding toward her
room.
</p>
<p>This time the girl heard the woman&#8217;s voice&mdash;and
her words:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes she&#8217;s there, the stuck-up hussy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice was that of the slattern.
</p>
<p>The man laughed jeeringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealous, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, she <i>is</i> a mighty
good-looking girl, for a fact!&#8221;
</p>
<p>That was all. The girl heard Deveny step into a
room&mdash;the room adjoining hers; she could hear his
heavy boots striking the floor as he removed them.
</p>
<p>For a long time the girl rested on her elbow, listening;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
but no further sounds came from the room into
which Deveny had gone. At last, trembling, her face
white with fear, the girl got up and stole noiselessly
to the door.
</p>
<p>A light bolt was the door&#8217;s only fastening; and the
girl stood long, with a hand upon it, considering its
frailty. How easy it would be for a big man like
Deveny to force the door. One shove of his giant
shoulder and the bolt would give.
</p>
<p>Stealthily, noiselessly, straining with every ounce of
her strength, she managed to lift the cheap bureau and
carry it to the door, placing it against the latter, barricading
it. Not satisfied, she dragged the bed over
against the bureau.
</p>
<p>Even when that had been accomplished, she was not
satisfied and during the greater part of the night she
sat on the edge of the bed, listening and watching the
door. For in the days that had fled Deveny had said
certain things to her that she had not repeated to her
father; he had looked at her with a significance that
no man could have understood; and there had been a
gleam in his eyes at these times which had convinced
her that behind the bland smoothness of him&mdash;back
of the suave politeness of his manner&mdash;was a primitive
animalism. His suave politeness was a velvet veil of
character behind which he masked the slavering fangs
of the beast he really was.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>HIS SHADOW BEFORE</h3>
</div>

<p>At ten o&#8217;clock the following morning, in a rear
room of &#8220;Balleau&#8217;s First Chance&#8221; saloon&mdash;which
was directly across the street from the Lamo
Eating-House&mdash;Luke Deveny and two other men
were sitting at a card-table with bottle and glasses
between them. A window in the eastern side of the
room gave the men an unobstructed view of the desert,
and for half an hour, as they talked and drank, they
looked out through the window.
</p>
<p>A tall, muscular man with a slightly hooked nose,
keen blue eyes with a cold glint in them, black hair,
and an equally black mustache which revealed a firm-lipped
mouth with curves at the corners that hinted of
cynicism, and, perhaps cruelty, was sitting at the table
so that he faced the window. His smile, as he again
glanced out of the window, roved to Deveny&mdash;who
sat at his right.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One man&mdash;an&#8217; a led horse,&#8221; he said shortly.
&#8220;Looks like Laskar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny&mdash;big, smooth-shaven&mdash;with black, glowing,
attractive eyes that held a glint quite as hard as
that which shone in the eyes of the speaker, looked
long out of the window at a moving dot on the desert,
which seemed to be traveling toward them. Deveny
had looked before; but now he saw two dots where at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
other times he had seen only one. His lips held a
slight pout as he glanced at the speaker.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Rogers,&#8221; he said; &#8220;there&#8217;s only one.
The old fool must have put up a fight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny filled a glass from the bottle and drank
slowly. His features were large. His nose was well
shaped, with wide nostrils that hinted of a fiery, passionate
nature; his thrusting chin and the heavy neck
muscles told of strength, both mental and physical&mdash;of
mental strength that was of a tenacious character,
of physical strength that would respond to any demand
of the will.
</p>
<p>He was handsome, and yet the suggestion of ruthlessness
in the atmosphere of him&mdash;lurking behind the
genial, easy-going exterior that he wore for appearances&mdash;or
because it was his nature to conceal his
passions until he desired to unleash them&mdash;was felt by
those who knew him intimately. It had been felt by
Barbara Morgan.
</p>
<p>Deveny was king of the lawless element in the Lamo
section. The magnetism of him; the arrogance,
glossed over with the calm and cold politeness of his
manner; his unvarying immaculateness; the air of large
and complete confidence which marked his every action;
the swiftness with which he struck when he was
aroused, or when his authority was questioned, placed
him without dissent at the head of the element that
ruled the Lamo country.
</p>
<p>Deveny ruled, but Deveny&#8217;s rule was irksome to
Strom Rogers&mdash;the man to whom Deveny had just
spoken. For while Deveny drank, Rogers watched
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
him with covert vigilance, with a jeering gleam far
back in his eyes, with a secret envy and jealousy, with
hatred and contempt and mockery.
</p>
<p>Yet there was fear in Rogers&#8217; eyes, too&mdash;a mere
glimmer of it. Yet it was there; and when Deveny set
his glass down and looked straight at Rogers, it was
that fear which brought the fawning, insincere smirk
to Rogers&#8217; lips.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See the girl?&#8221; questioned Rogers.
</p>
<p>Deveny laughed lowly. Apparently he did not notice
the glow in Rogers&#8217; eyes; but had Rogers looked
closely he might have seen Deveny&#8217;s lips straighten as
he shot a glance at the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Had the room next to her last night. Heard her
drag the bed in front of the door of her room. She
knew I was there, all right!&#8221; Deveny laughed deeply.
&#8220;She&#8217;s wised up by this time. Lolly Kaye hates her&mdash;because
Barbara&#8217;s a good-looking girl, I suppose.
That&#8217;s like some women. Lolly would see Barbara
roasting in hell and not give her a hand!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lolly&#8217;s been disappointed in love&mdash;I reckon.&#8221;
Rogers&#8217; laugh was hollow, mirthless. And again Deveny
shot a glance at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t bother her&mdash;Barbara?&#8221; questioned
Rogers in a dry, light voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; grinned Deveny; &#8220;that time hasn&#8217;t come&mdash;yet.
It&#8217;s coming soon. I told Lolly to keep an eye on
her; I&#8217;ve got Engle and Barthman and Kelmer watching
at the doors so Barbara can&#8217;t light out for the
Rancho Seco. She don&#8217;t get away until tomorrow.
Then she goes with me to the end of Sunset Trail.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
I&#8217;ve sent Shorty Mallo to Willow&#8217;s Wells for the
parson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara know what&#8217;s up?&#8221; Rogers&#8217; voice was
low and throaty.
</p>
<p>Again Deveny glanced at him&mdash;sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell, no!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;It&#8217;s none of her damned
business&mdash;nor anybody&#8217;s!&#8221; He grinned maliciously
when he saw Rogers&#8217; face whiten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara will need a husband now,&#8221; Deveny went
on. &#8220;With old Morgan gone and her brother sloped
from the home ranch, she&#8217;ll be kind of lonesome. I
aim to cure her of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed, and Rogers writhed inwardly. For
Rogers had long nursed a secret hope that one day
the fates might take a notion to give him the chance
that Deveny intended to seize.
</p>
<p>But Rogers was forced to conceal his jealousy and
disappointment. He laughed mirthlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So she can&#8217;t get away, eh?&mdash;she&#8217;s corralled!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; declared Deveny; &#8220;she won&#8217;t want to get
away&mdash;once she knows what I mean&mdash;that it&#8217;s going
to be a regular wedding. She&#8217;ll raise a fuss, most
likely, to make folks believe she&#8217;s unwilling, but in the
end she&#8217;ll get over it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny glanced out of the window at the blot that
was now closer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Laskar, all regular,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s leading
a sorrel horse&mdash;Dolver&#8217;s horse. Old Morgan got
Dolver&mdash;looks like, the damned old gopher! Men
as willing as Dolver are not found every day.&#8221; He
looked at the third man, who had not spoken.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lawson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you mosey down the trail a
little piece and meet Laskar. Bring him here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lawson, a thin-faced, medium-sized man with narrow
shoulders, whose distinguishing mark was a set of
projecting upper teeth that kept his mouth in a continual
smirking smile, got up quickly and went out.
Deveny and Rogers, their thoughts centered upon the
same person&mdash;Barbara Morgan&mdash;sat silent, watching
Lawson as he rode down the street toward the
point where the trail, crossing the broken stretch of
country that intervened, merged into the desert.
</p>
<p>Half an hour later Laskar, holding his chest, where
Purgatory had kicked him, was sitting at the table in
the rear room of the First Chance, cursing with a
fluency that he had not yielded to in many years.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolver&#8217;s wiped out!&#8221; he gasped hoarsely;
&#8220;plugged so quick he didn&#8217;t know he was hit. A center
shot&mdash;plumb in the heart; his own gun goin&#8217; off
while he was fallin&#8217;. I looked him over&mdash;after. He
was croaked complete. Then that sober-faced hyena
lifts my gun&mdash;an&#8217; the rifle&mdash;an&#8217; says things to me,
which I don&#8217;t try to cross him. Then he goes behind
the rock&mdash;where we was havin&#8217; it out&mdash;an&#8217; while he&#8217;s
gone I tries to git my guns from under that devil-eyed
cayuse of his&#8217;n.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I don&#8217;t succeed&mdash;noways. That black devil
turns on a half-dollar an&#8217; plants his hoofs plumb in my
breast-bone. If I&#8217;d been an inch nearer, or if he&#8217;d
have kicked me a foot lower, or a foot higher, I&#8217;d be
layin&#8217; out there where Dolver is now, the coyotes an&#8217;
the buzzards gnawin&#8217; at me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>Unmoved by Laskar&#8217;s incoherence, Deveny calmly
watched him. And now, when Laskar paused for
breath, Deveny spoke slowly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;A <i>black</i> horse, you said. How did a black horse
get there? Old Morgan rode a bay when he left
Lamo&mdash;Balleau says.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say Morgan rode a black horse?&#8221; queried
Laskar, knowledge in his eyes that he had a thing to
tell that would blanch their faces. He grinned, still
holding his chest, his glance malicious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say a <i>black</i> horse?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Did I
say Morgan rode a black horse? Morgan didn&#8217;t.
Morgan rode a bay&mdash;an&#8217; the Chief run it off after he
shot Morgan. But Morgan didn&#8217;t die right away, an&#8217;
the Chief he had to slope, he said&mdash;an&#8217; he did&mdash;leavin&#8217;
me an&#8217; Dolver to finish old Morgan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We was tryin&#8217; our damnedest when this guy on the
black horse pops up out of nowhere an&#8217; salivates Dolver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was Deveny. He was now leaning forward,
a pout on his lips, watching Laskar with an intent,
glowering gaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan!&#8221; shouted Laskar. His face
lighted with a hideous joy as he watched the effect of
his news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan! Do you hear?&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;&#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan, the Pardo &#8216;two-gun&#8217; man! He&#8217;s
headed toward Lamo. He bored Dolver, an&#8217; he said
that soon as Morgan cashed in he was hittin&#8217; the
breeze for here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>Lawson, the man who had gone to meet Laskar,
ejaculated hoarsely, and stood rigid, his mouth open,
his eyes bulging. It was the involuntary expression of
the astonishment and fear that had seized him. Laskar
forgot the pain in his chest long enough to
straighten and grin at Lawson.
</p>
<p>Rogers&#8217; face had changed color. He, too, had become
rigid. He had been in the act of reaching for
the bottle on the table, and the hand that had been
extended had been suddenly drawn back, so that the
hand was now midway between his body and the bottle&mdash;and
the fingers were clenched. The other hand,
under the table, was likewise clenched, and the muscles
of his jaws were corded. Into his eyes had come a
furtive, restless gleam, and his face had paled.
</p>
<p>Deveny gave no visible sign of perturbation. He
coolly reached out, grasped the bottle that Rogers had
been reaching for, and poured some of the amber fluid
into one of the glasses. The other men watched him
silently&mdash;all of them intent to note the tremor they
expected to see.
</p>
<p>Deveny&#8217;s hand did not tremble. He noted the
glances of the men&mdash;the admiration that came into
their eyes as with steady muscles he raised the glass
and drank&mdash;and he smiled with slight contempt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming here, eh?&#8221; he said evenly. &#8220;So he said
that. Did he mention what he was coming for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mention,&#8221; replied Laskar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So he downed Dolver. Did he say what for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Said Dolver had shot up his partner, Davey
Langan&mdash;back in Pardo. Harlan was evenin&#8217; up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about Harlan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The question was addressed to all of them.
</p>
<p>Rogers answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bad guy&mdash;all bad. He&#8217;s an iceberg, an&#8217;
he&#8217;s got the snakiest gun-hand of any man in the
country. Draws hesitatin&#8217;-like. A man don&#8217;t know
when he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to uncork his smoke-wagons. I seen
him put Lefty Blandin&#8217; out. He starts for his guns,
an&#8217; then kind of stops, trickin&#8217; the other guy into goin&#8217;
for his. Then, before the other guy can get his gun to
workin&#8217;, Harlan&#8217;s stickin&#8217; his away, an&#8217; the guy&#8217;s ready
for the mourners.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan got his handle that way. He goes for his
guns so slow an&#8217; hesitatin&#8217; that he seems to drag &#8217;em
out. But some way he&#8217;s always shootin&#8217; first. An&#8217;
they always let him off because it&#8217;s mighty plain that
the other guy tried to draw first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that,&#8221; said Deveny slowly. &#8220;What&#8217;s
his record?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plays her a lone hand,&#8221; returned Rogers. He
watched the other steadily.
</p>
<p>Deveny toyed with a glass as he gazed out of the
window. There was a cold, sullen gleam in his eyes
when he finally looked at Laskar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said Harlan told you he was coming here as
soon as Morgan cashed in. According to that, Morgan
must have been hit bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chief said he bored him plenty. An&#8217; me an&#8217;
Dolver must have got him some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t get a chance to search Morgan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance&mdash;he fit like a hyena; an&#8217; when he got
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
behind that damned rock there was no way of gettin&#8217;
at him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Deveny, &#8220;according to what you say,
Harlan will come here as soon as Morgan dies. And
when you left there Morgan was in a bad way. Harlan
is due most any time, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I figger,&#8221; agreed Laskar.
</p>
<p>And now Laskar fidgeted. &#8220;I aim to be hittin&#8217; the
breeze now&mdash;before Harlan hits town. This climate
is gettin&#8217; unhealthy for me. Harlan give me notice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To leave town?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Deveny who spoke. There was a snarl in
his voice; he leaned forward and scowled at Laskar.
</p>
<p>Laskar nodded.
</p>
<p>Rogers cleared his throat, and Lawson moved his
feet uneasily.
</p>
<p>Deveny&#8217;s scowl faded; he grinned coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving orders&mdash;is he?&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;Well,
we&#8217;ll see.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;When Harlan hits town
it will be a sign that old Morgan&#8217;s crossed the Divide.
Well, there was no witnesses to Morgan&#8217;s cashing in,
and one man&#8217;s word is as good as another&#8217;s in this
country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;?&#8221; questioned Rogers, noting the light in
Deveny&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that Laskar is going&mdash;right now&mdash;to
whisper into Sheriff Gage&#8217;s ear that he saw our friend,
&#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan, killing old Morgan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rogers got to his feet, grinning. The gleam in his
eyes indicated that he felt some relief over the prospect
presented by Deveny&#8217;s suggestion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we ain&#8217;t sure Harlan means to make
trouble here,&#8221; he told Deveny; &#8220;but it&#8217;s just as well to
shove him off onto the sheriff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The four men walked to the front door of the First
Chance, after pausing for a few minutes at the bar.
</p>
<p>Outside, halting for an instant on the board platform
in front of the saloon, Rogers, who had been the
first to emerge, started as he glanced toward the desert,
and then stood rigid, shading his hands with his eyes
against the sun that poured into his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s comin&#8217; now!&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Deveny and the others also looked into the blinding
glare of the sun&mdash;likewise shading their eyes.
And they saw, far out upon the vast sea of sand&mdash;yet
not so far that they could not distinguish objects&mdash;a
black horse coming steadily toward them.
</p>
<p>Deveny was strangely silent, glowering toward the
desert; Rogers folded his arms and faced the oncoming
rider and the somber-coated animal he bestrode; Lawson
scowled; and Laskar nervously estimated the distance
that stretched between himself and the steady-eyed
man who had told him certain things in a voice
that had been entirely convincing.

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A PRISON</h3>
</div>

<p>Barbara Morgan had not been able to sleep
except by fits and starts. A dozen times during
the night she had caught herself on the verge of sinking
into deep slumber, and each time she had got up
and washed her eyes with some water from a pitcher
on the bureau, determined that she would not take
any chances of permitting Deveny to surprise her.
</p>
<p>When the dawn came she was haggard and tired;
and she got up listlessly, combed her hair, and washed
her face, and dragged away the pieces of furniture that
had formed the barricade at the door.
</p>
<p>She felt more secure with the dawn, and when the
sunlight began to stream into the east windows she
opened the door of the room, descended the stairs, and
took a short walk to the edge of town.
</p>
<p>Returning, she saw a man arrayed in overalls, boots,
a blue woolen shirt, and broad felt hat, standing in
the doorway of the stable that, she felt, belonged to
the Eating-House. Sight of the stable brought to her
thoughts of her horse&mdash;Billy&mdash;and she decided to
determine if the man who had taken charge of him had
put him into the stable.
</p>
<p>She paused before the door, directly in front of the
man, who did not move aside to permit her to enter.
</p>
<p>She thought at first that he was not aware of her
desire&mdash;until she observed an amused light in his eyes;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
and then she knew that he was purposely barring her
way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Eating-House stable, I suppose?&#8221; she
inquired quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re supposin&#8217; is a heap correct, ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
grinned the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you will kindly step aside I
shall see if my horse is all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your horse is all right, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; returned the man.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just fed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Irritated by his attitude, she spoke sharply:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Step aside, please; I am going into the stable!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man grinned widely. &#8220;It&#8217;s ag&#8217;in&#8217; orders,
ma&#8217;am; you&#8217;ll have to stay out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose orders?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deveny&#8217;s. You ain&#8217;t to go into the stable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She hesitated, afflicted with a queer sensation of
weakness and indecision.
</p>
<p>It was her fear of Deveny, she supposed, that made
her feel that way, together with the conviction that
Deveny must have known that she had been in the
room next to the one he had taken, even before he had
ascended the stairs. It seemed to her that this deliberate
interference with her must be inspired by evil
intentions, and for an instant panic overtook her.
</p>
<p>Then, yielding to the flash of anger that surged over
her, she drew the small revolver she always carried
with her on her rides, and presented it. She stepped
back a little, so that the man might not strike the
weapon from her hand, and spoke shortly, commandingly
to him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get away from that door!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shootin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am?&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He grinned at her and calmly began to roll a cigarette,
at which action she gulped with dismay, wheeled
swiftly, and walked to the stairs. She went up proudly
enough, her head held high, for she divined that the
man would be watching her. But when she entered
her room her pride forsook her, and she sank into a
chair by the east window, dismayed and frightened.
</p>
<p>While she sat there the slatternly woman slowly
opened the door and stuck her head in. She grinned
widely at Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; ridin&#8217; this mawnin&#8217;, deary?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara looked at her, saw the mockery in the
jealous eyes, and turned her head again, making no
reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too stuck up to talk, eh?&#8221; jibed the slattern.
&#8220;Well, before you get out of here you&#8217;ll be tickled
enough to shoot off your gab. Bah! You an&#8217; your
airs! If you want any grub this mawnin&#8217; you&#8217;ll come
down an&#8217; grab it yourself, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She slammed the door, her jeering laugh penetrating
the partition with hideous resonance.
</p>
<p>After the woman had gone Barbara got up, her lips
set in resolute lines.
</p>
<p>Once in the hall she started to walk toward the
stairs, when she saw the cowboy of the stable lounging
against the rail on the platform. He saw her at the
instant she looked at him, and he grinned hugely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ve noticed I&#8217;ve sort of shifted,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I keep goin&#8217; up&mdash;gettin&#8217; higher in the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; she demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just loafin&#8217;, I reckon,&#8221; grinned the other. &#8220;An&#8217;
obeyin&#8217; orders,&#8221; he added instantly. &#8220;Much as I hate
to disconvenience a lady, I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; no chances on
rilin&#8217; Deveny.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that Deveny placed you here to
watch me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t issue no particular orders as to where
I was to do my standin&#8217;. But he was sure earnest about
sayin&#8217; that you wasn&#8217;t to leave your room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I left it once this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My fault,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;I was sneakin&#8217; a drink
in the Antler, an&#8217; you slipped me. I&#8217;m bettin&#8217; it don&#8217;t
happen ag&#8217;in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overcome with a cold terror that suddenly seized
her, Barbara wheeled and re-entered her room, standing
for an instant at the door as she locked it, and
then walking to the chair and sinking nervelessly into
it.
</p>
<p>Somehow, she sensed the futility of further effort at
escape. She was aware of Deveny&#8217;s power in the
country; she knew that he ruled Lamo as he ruled
every foot of land in the section; and she was convinced
that it would be wasted effort to call for help.
Even her own sex&mdash;represented by the slattern, and
most of the women in Lamo were of that type, in
character&mdash;seemed to be antagonistic toward her. It
seemed to her that they would mock her as the slattern
had mocked her, should she appeal to them.
</p>
<p>And as for the men of Lamo, they were not to be
considered. She was certain she could not induce one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
of them to act contrary to Deveny&#8217;s wishes. For her
father had told her about Lamo&#8217;s men&mdash;how they
were slaves to the will of the man whose deeds of
outlawry had made him feared wherever men congregated;
and she knew Lamo itself was a sink-hole of
iniquity where women were swallowed by the evil
passions of men.
</p>
<p>She might have appealed to Gage, the sheriff, and
she thought of Gage while she sat at the window. But
Gage, her father had told her, with disgust in his eyes,
was a man of colorless personality and of little courage&mdash;a
negligible character upon whom the good people
of the section, who were pitifully few, could not depend.
Her father had told her that it was his opinion
that Gage, too, was a slave to Deveny&#8217;s will.
</p>
<p>She wished now that she had not yielded to the
impulse which had brought her to Lamo; but her lips
grew firm and her eyes defiant as she at last got up and
walked to one of the front windows.
</p>
<p>Now, more vividly than ever, could she understand
the significance of Deveny&#8217;s glances at her in the past;
the light in his eyes had been an expression of premeditated
evil, awaiting an opportunity.
</p>
<p>She was pale, and her hands were trembling as she
placed them on the sill of the front window and
glanced down into the street, hoping that she might
see a friendly face; praying that one of the Rancho
Seco men might have come to town during the night.
</p>
<p>But she saw no one she knew. Indeed, except for a
pony standing in front of a saloon down the street a
little distance, and several others hitched to a rail
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
across the street, in front of the First Chance saloon,
Lamo seemed to be deserted. And a silence, deep and
portentous of evil, seemed to have settled over the
town.
</p>
<p>But as she leaned upon the sill a sound floated to her
through the open window&mdash;a man&#8217;s voice, so close to
her that it made her start and stiffen. It was Deveny&#8217;s
voice, and it seemed to come from a point in the street
directly beneath the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find Gage?&#8221; it said.
</p>
<p>Barbara leaned forward a little and looked downward.
Below her, on the narrow board-walk that ran
in front of the Eating-House, were four men. She
recognized three of them&mdash;Deveny, Strom Rogers,
and Meeder Lawson, the Rancho Seco foreman.
</p>
<p>The other man was a stranger. Evidently it was
the stranger to whom Deveny had spoken, for it was
the stranger who answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in his office now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny turned to Lawson and Rogers. &#8220;You two
wait here, Laskar and myself will do the talking to
Gage.&#8221; He started away with the man who had answered
him; then called back over his shoulder:
&#8220;Hang around; if there&#8217;s trouble, you&#8217;ll want to get
in on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny and Laskar walked down the street; the girl
saw them enter the building occupied by the sheriff.
</p>
<p>Wondering, intensely curious&mdash;for that word
&#8220;trouble&#8221; meant shooting in the vocabulary of men of
the Deveny type&mdash;Barbara drew back until she was
certain the men in the street could not see her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>When Deveny and Laskar disappeared, Strom
Rogers laughed sneeringly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deveny&#8217;s scared of &#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan, I reckon. It&#8217;s
a cheap frame-up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, hell,&#8221; jibed the other; &#8220;you&#8217;re jealous, that&#8217;s
all. You&#8217;d like to see Harlan plug Deveny, eh; so&#8217;s
you&#8217;d have a chance with Barbara Morgan. I&#8217;d be a
heap careful, if I was you, Rogers. Deveny knows
you took a shine to Barbara Morgan. I seen him
lookin&#8217; hostile at you when you was quizzin&#8217; him in
Balleau&#8217;s. He&#8217;s next.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a free country,&#8221; returned Rogers. The
girl caught the malignant note in his voice, and she
leaned outward a little, trying to see his face, while she
shivered with dread.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; laughed Lawson; &#8220;a man can cash in without
any excuse, usual; all he&#8217;s got to do is to cross
Deveny. You&#8217;re a damned fool, Strom, to go to takin&#8217;
a shine to Barbara Morgan, when Deveny wants her.
He&#8217;s been waitin&#8217; for her, an&#8217; meanin&#8217; to have her, all
along. He&#8217;s only been waitin&#8217; until ol&#8217; Morgan cashed
in, so&#8217;s he&#8217;d have a chance to take her. Now that
Morgan&#8217;s dead his chance has come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Silently, her face dead white, her eyes closed, Barbara
slipped backward and crumpled into a heap on
the dirty carpet of the room.
</p>
<p>When she again opened her eyes it was to look
wildly at the open window through which the terrible
news had come. Then she dragged herself to it, and
making no sound leaned her arms on the sill and listened
again, her heart seeming to be in the clutch of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
icy fingers, her brain atrophied, reeling in a chaos of
incoherent, agonized impulses.
</p>
<p>She did not know how long she had been unconscious.
She saw that Rogers and Lawson were still
below, and still talking. So keen was her sense of
hearing&mdash;every nerve straining in the effort to learn
more&mdash;that the voices of the men came in through
the window with a resonance that, she felt, must be
audible to every person in Lamo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t my style, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;d meet Harlan on
the level, man to man, if he was lookin&#8217; for me. It&#8217;s
likely he ain&#8217;t at that. I&#8217;ve heard, bad as he is, that
he plays square. An&#8217; if I was runnin&#8217; things I&#8217;d take
a look at him before chargin&#8217; him with killin&#8217; Lane
Morgan, when the killin&#8217; had been done by the Chief,
an&#8217; Dolver, an&#8217; Laskar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Strom Rogers&#8217; voice. It bore conviction
with it, even though there was passionate feeling
behind it, mingled strangely with personal hatred and
jealousy.
</p>
<p>Dumbly, Barbara clutched the window-sill. One
dry, agonized sob racked her; and then she sat on
the floor, to stare vacantly at the dingy walls of the
room.
</p>
<p>Once more she heard Rogers&#8217; voice; this time there
was a note of savage glee in it:
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Harlan now, just slippin&#8217; off his cayuse in
front of Gage&#8217;s place. &#8216;Drag,&#8217; eh? Well, there don&#8217;t
seem to be nothin&#8217; impedin&#8217; his actions anywhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prompted by the urge of a curiosity that she could
not resist, Barbara reeled to her feet, and with her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
hands resting on the window-sill leaned out and looked
up the street.
</p>
<p>In front of the sheriff&#8217;s office, not more than thirty
or forty feet distant, she saw a tall, well-built man
standing beside the hitching rail that fringed the board
sidewalk. He had evidently just dismounted, and he
was standing at the head of a big, coal-black horse.
He was in the act of hitching the animal, and his back
was toward her.
</p>
<p>She watched breathlessly until he turned. And then
she stared hard at him, noting the steady, cold, alert
eyes; the firm lips; the bigness of him, the atmosphere
of capableness that seemed to surround him; the low-swung
guns at his hips, with no flaps on the holster-tops,
and the bottoms of the holsters tied to his leather
chaps with rawhide thongs.
</p>
<p>Never had she seen a man like him. For some
reason, as yet inexplicable to her, he brought into her
troubled consciousness a feeling of cold calm, a refreshing
influence that might be compared to the sweep
of a cool and unexpected breeze in the middle of a
hot day.
</p>
<p>He dominated the group of men that instantly surrounded
him; and the dominance was not of attire, for
he was arrayed like the others. She saw Deveny
standing near him, and the man Laskar behind Deveny
and Sheriff Gage and several other men. And
she saw Rogers and Lawson as they walked slowly
toward him.
</p>
<p>And then a realization of her loss, of the tragedy
that had descended upon her, again assailed her; and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
fury of intolerance against inaction seized her. She
could not stay in this room and suffer the hideous uncertainty;
she could not take Rogers&#8217; word that her
father had been killed. There must be some mistake.
Perhaps Rogers knew she was at the window, listening,
and he had said that just to spite her. For she had discouraged
Rogers&#8217; advances as she had discouraged
Deveny&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>Breathing fast, she unlocked the door and went out
into the hall.
</p>
<p>The man whom Deveny had placed to guard her
was still lounging on the stair platform, and he grinned
when he saw her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Comin&#8217; to try ag&#8217;in?&#8221; he grinned.
</p>
<p>She smiled&mdash;a disarming smile that brought a fatuous
gleam into the man&#8217;s eyes, so that he permitted
her to come close to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deveny&#8217;s got damn&#8217; good judgment,&#8221; he said as
she halted near him. &#8220;He knows a thoroughbred
when he sees&mdash;Hell!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ejaculation came from his lips as Barbara
leaped swiftly past him. He threw out a futile arm,
and stood for an instant, shocked into inaction as
Barbara ran down the stairs toward the street. Then
the man leaped after her, cursing. She could hear him
saying: &#8220;Damn your hide! Damn your hide!&#8221; as
he came after her, his spurs jangling on the steps.

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CHAIN-LIGHTNING</h3>
</div>

<p>Turning from Purgatory, after he had dismounted
in front of the sheriff&#8217;s office, Harlan
faced three men who stood just outside of the building,
watching him.
</p>
<p>The slightly humorous smile that curved Harlan&#8217;s
lips might have betrayed his reason for dismounting
in front of the sheriff&#8217;s office, for he had seen Laskar
standing with the two other men. But no man could
have told that he looked at Laskar directly, except
Laskar himself, who would have sworn that Harlan
did not remove his gaze from him, once he had slipped
from Purgatory&#8217;s back.
</p>
<p>For Harlan&#8217;s eyes told nothing. They seemed to be
gazing at nothing, and at everything. For Gage,
watching the man, was certain Harlan was looking
directly at him as he grinned, and Deveny, like Laskar,
was sure Harlan&#8217;s gaze was upon him. And all
of them, noting one another&#8217;s embarrassment, stood
silent, marveling.
</p>
<p>And now Deveny discovered that Harlan was
watching the three of them together&mdash;a trick which
is accomplished by fixing the gaze upon some object
straight in front of one; in this case it was Deveny&#8217;s
collar&mdash;and then including other objects on each side
of the center object.
</p>
<p>Steady nerves and an inflexible will are required to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
keep the gaze unwavering, and a complete absence of
self-consciousness. Thus Deveny knew he was standing
in the presence of a man whose poise and self-control
were marvelous; and he knew, too, that Harlan
would be aware of the slightest move made by either
of the three; more, he could detect any sign of concerted
action.
</p>
<p>And concerted action was what Deveny and Laskar
and the sheriff had planned. And they had purposely
dragged Laskar outside, expecting Harlan would do
just as he had done, and as his eyes warned he intended
to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m after you, Laskar,&#8221; he said softly.
</p>
<p>Laskar stiffened. He made no move, keeping his
hands at his sides, where they had been all the time
that had elapsed since Harlan had dismounted.
</p>
<p>Laskar&#8217;s eyes moved quickly, with an inquiring flash
in them, toward Deveny and the sheriff. It was time
for Deveny and the sheriff to precipitate the action
they had agreed upon.
</p>
<p>But the sheriff did not move. Nor did Deveny
change his position. A queer, cold chill had come over
Deveny&mdash;a vague dread, a dragging reluctance&mdash;an
indecision that startled him and made of his thoughts
an odd jumble of half-formed impulses that seemed to
die before they could become definite.
</p>
<p>He had faced gun-fighters before, and had felt no
fear of them. But something kept drumming into his
ears at this instant with irritating insistence that this
was not an ordinary man; that standing before him,
within three paces, his eyes swimming in an unfixed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
vacuity which indicated preparation for violent action,
was Harlan&mdash;&#8220;Drag&#8221; Harlan, the Pardo two-gun
man; Harlan, who had never been beaten in a gunfight.
</p>
<p>Could he&mdash;Deveny&mdash;beat him? Could he, now,
with &#8220;Drag&#8221; Harlan watching the three of them,
could he draw with any hope of success, with the hope
of beating the other&#8217;s lightning hand on the downward
flash to life or death?
</p>
<p>Deveny paled; he was afraid to take the chance.
His eyes wavered from Harlan&#8217;s; he cast a furtive
glance at the sheriff.
</p>
<p>Harlan caught the glance, smiled mirthlessly and
spoke shortly to Laskar:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you to keep hittin&#8217; the breeze till there
wasn&#8217;t any more breeze,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I ought to have
bored you out there by the red rock. I gave you your
chance. Flash your gun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was Gage. His voice sounded as though it
had been forced out: it was hoarse and hollow.
</p>
<p>Harlan did not move, nor did his eyes waver. There
was feeling in them now: intense, savage, cold. And
his voice snapped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the sheriff, eh? You want to gas, I reckon.
Do it quick before this coyote goes for his gun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sheriff cleared his throat. &#8220;You&#8217;re under arrest,
Harlan, for killin&#8217; Lane Morgan out there in the
desert yesterday.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s eyes narrowed, his lips wreathed into a
feline smile. But he did not change his position.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the witness against me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laskar.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he testified?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan backed away a little. His grin was tiger-like,
a yellow flame seemed to leap in his eyes. Laskar,
realizing at last that he could hope for no assistance
from Gage or Deveny, grew rigid with desperation.
</p>
<p>Death was in front of him; he knew it. Death or a
deathless fame. The fates had willed one or the other,
and he chose to take the gambler&#8217;s chance, the chance
he and Dolver and the Chief had refused Lane Morgan.
</p>
<p>Deathless fame, the respect and the admiration of
every man in the section was his if he beat &#8220;Drag&#8221;
Harlan to the draw. Forever afterward, if he beat
Harlan, he would be pointed at as the man who had
met the Pardo gunman on even terms and had downed
him.
</p>
<p>He stepped out a little, away from the front of the
building, edging off from Deveny and Gage so that
Harlan would have to watch in two directions.
</p>
<p>Lawson and Rogers, having advanced to a position
within a dozen paces of the group in front of the
sheriff&#8217;s office, now backed away, silent, watchful.
Other men who had been standing near were on the
move instantly. Some dove into convenient doorways,
others withdrew to a little distance down the street.
But all intently watched as Laskar showed by his actions
that he intended to accept his chance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Deveny, too, watched intently. He kept his gaze
fixed upon Harlan, not even glancing toward Laskar.
For Deveny&#8217;s fear had gone, now that the dread presence
had centered its attention elsewhere, and he was
determined to discover the secret of Harlan&#8217;s hesitating
&#8220;draw,&#8221; the curious movement that had given the
man his sobriquet, &#8220;Drag.&#8221; The discovery of that
secret might mean much to him in the future; it might
even mean life to him if Harlan decided to remain in
the section.
</p>
<p>Harlan had made no hostile movement as yet. He
still stood where he had stood all along, except for the
slight backward step he had taken before Laskar began
to move. But he watched Laskar as the latter edged
away from the other men, and when he saw Laskar&#8217;s
eyes widen with the thought that precedes action, with
the gleam that reflects the command the brain transmutes
to the muscles, his right hand flashed downward
toward the hip.
</p>
<p>With a grunt, for Harlan had almost anticipated his
thoughts, Laskar&#8217;s right hand swept toward the butt
of his pistol.
</p>
<p>But Harlan&#8217;s hand had come to a poise, just above
the stock of his weapon&mdash;a pause so infinitesimal that
it was merely a suggestion of a pause.
</p>
<p>It was enough, however, to throw Laskar off his
mental balance, and as he drew his weapon he glanced
at Harlan&#8217;s holster.
</p>
<p>A dozen men who watched swore afterward that
Laskar drew his gun first; that it was in his hand
when Harlan&#8217;s bullet struck him. But Deveny knew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
better; he knew that Laskar was dead on his feet before
the muzzle of his weapon had cleared the holster,
and that the shot he had fired had been the result of
involuntary muscular action; that he had pulled the
trigger after Harlan&#8217;s bullet struck him, and while his
gun had been loosening in his hand.
</p>
<p>For Deveny had seen the bullet from Laskar&#8217;s gun
throw up sand at Harlan&#8217;s feet after Harlan&#8217;s weapon
had sent its death to meet Laskar. And Deveny had
discovered the secret of Harlan&#8217;s &#8220;draw.&#8221; The pause
was a trick, of course, to disconcert an adversary.
But the lightning flash of Harlan&#8217;s hand to his gun-butt
was no trick. It was sheer rapidity, his hand moving
so fast that the eye could not follow.
</p>
<p>And Deveny could get no pleasure from his discovery.
Harlan had waited until Laskar&#8217;s fingers were
wrapped around the stock of his pistol before he had
drawn his own, and therefore in the minds of those
who had witnessed the shooting, Harlan had been
justified.
</p>
<p>Sheriff Gage thought so, too. For, after Laskar&#8217;s
body had been carried away, Harlan stepped to where
the sheriff stood and spoke shortly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wantin&#8217; me for this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sheriff Gage shook his head. &#8220;I reckon everybody
saw Laskar go for his gun. There was no <i>call</i> for him
to go for his gun. If you&#8217;d have shot him without him
reachin&#8217; for it things would have been different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan said coldly, &#8220;I&#8217;m ready for that trial, now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The sheriff&#8217;s eyes glowed with some secret significance
as they met Harlan&#8217;s. He was standing at a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
little distance from Deveny, and he deliberately closed
an eye at Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Trial&mdash;hell!&#8221; he declared, &#8220;you&#8217;ve destroyed the
evidence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan wheeled, to see Deveny standing near. And
for an instant as their eyes met&mdash;Harlan&#8217;s level and
cold, Deveny&#8217;s aflame with a hostility unmistakable&mdash;the
crowd which had witnessed the shooting of Laskar
again became motionless, while a silence, portending
further violence, descended over the street.
</p>
<p>Then Deveny abruptly wheeled and began to walk
across to the First Chance.
</p>
<p>He had not taken many steps, however, when there
were sounds of commotion farther down the street
toward the Eating-House&mdash;a man cursing and a girl
screaming.
</p>
<p>Deveny halted and faced the point from which the
sounds came, and a scowl appeared on his face.
</p>
<p>Harlan wheeled, also. And he saw, at a little distance
down the street, a girl running, her hair tossing
in a mass around her, her eyes wild with fright and
terror. Behind her came a man, cursing as he ran.
</p>
<p>Harlan heard Sheriff Gage curse, too&mdash;heard him
say:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Lane Morgan&#8217;s daughter&mdash;Barbara!
What in hell is she doin&#8217; here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl, not more than a dozen feet ahead of her
pursuer, ran straight toward Harlan. And when&mdash;as
she drew closer and he saw that she was, indeed,
actually coming toward him&mdash;her eyes on him as
though she had singled him out as a protector&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
advanced toward her, drawing one of his guns as he
went.
</p>
<p>And, grinning as she neared him, he opened his
arms wide and she ran straight into them, and laid
her head on his shoulder, sobbing, and talking incoherently.
While Harlan, his grin fading as he
looked at her pursuer&mdash;who had halted within half a
dozen paces of the girl&mdash;commanded lowly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re runnin&#8217; plumb into a heap of trouble, mister
man. Throw your rope around the snubbin&#8217; post.
Then get on your hind legs an&#8217; do some explainin&#8217;.
What you chasin&#8217; this girl for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man reddened, looked downward, then up at
Deveny. The latter, a pout on his lips, his eyes glowing
savagely, walked to where Harlan stood with one
arm around the girl, while Lawson, Rogers, Gage, and
several other men advanced slowly and stood near
him.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>SINGLE-HANDED</h3>
</div>

<p>Noting the concerted movement toward him,
Harlan grinned at Barbara, gently disengaged
himself from her grasp, and urged her toward the
door of the sheriff&#8217;s office. She made no objection,
for she felt that further trouble impended, and she
knew she must not impede any action her rescuer
planned.
</p>
<p>Reaching the street a few minutes before, she had
noted the preparations for the swift tragedy that had
followed; and despite her wild desire to escape Deveny&#8217;s
man, she had halted, fascinated by the spectacle
presented by the two men, gambling with death.
</p>
<p>She had halted at a little distance, crouching against
the front of a building. And while she had been
crouching there, trembling with a new apprehension,
her pursuer had caught her.
</p>
<p>She had hardly been aware of him, and his grasp on
her arm she had not resisted, so intense was her interest
in what was transpiring. But the sudden ending of
the affair brought again into her consciousness the
recollection of her own peril, and when she saw Deveny
cross the street she broke from the man&#8217;s restraining
grasp and ran to Harlan, convinced that he&mdash;because
he seemed to be antagonistic toward the forces
arrayed against her&mdash;would protect her.
</p>
<p>And now, shrinking into the open doorway of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
sheriff&#8217;s office, she watched breathlessly, with straining
senses, the moving figures in the drama.
</p>
<p>Harlan had backed a little way toward the doorway
in which Barbara stood. The movement was
strategic, and had been accomplished with deliberation.
He was facing Lamo&#8217;s population&mdash;at least
that proportion of it which was at home&mdash;with the
comforting assurance that no part of it could get behind
him.
</p>
<p>The gun he had drawn upon the approach of Barbara&#8217;s
pursuer was still in his right hand. It menaced
no one, and yet it seemed to menace everyone within
range of it.
</p>
<p>For though the gun was held loosely in Harlan&#8217;s
hand, the muzzle downward, there was a glow in the
man&#8217;s eyes that conveyed a warning.
</p>
<p>The smile on his face, too, was pregnant with the
promise of violence. It was a surface smile, penetrating
no deeper than his lips, and behind it, partially
masked by the smile, the men in the group in the
street could detect the destroying passion that ruled
the man at this instant.
</p>
<p>Deveny, who had approached to a point within a
dozen feet of Harlan, came to a slow, reluctant halt
when he caught a glimpse of the strange glow in Harlan&#8217;s
eyes. All the others, Sheriff Gage included, likewise
halted&mdash;most of them at a considerable distance,
as their conceptions of prudence suggested.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s grin grew ironic as he noted the pause&mdash;the
concerted rigidity of Lamo&#8217;s population.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems there&#8217;s a heap of folks wantin&#8217; to palaver,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
he said lowly. &#8220;An&#8217; no one is crowdin&#8217; me. That&#8217;s
polite an&#8217; proper. Seems you all sort of guessed
there&#8217;s plenty of room, an&#8217; crowdin&#8217; ain&#8217;t necessary.
I&#8217;d thank every specimen to hook his thumbs in the
armholes of his vest&mdash;same as though he&#8217;s a member
of the pussy-café outfit which I&#8217;ve seen in Chicago,
makin&#8217; moon-eyes at girls. If there&#8217;s any of you ain&#8217;t
got on vests, why, you can fasten your sky-hooks on
your shoulders any way to suit your idee of safety.
Get them up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It seemed ludicrous to Barbara, despite the shadow
of tragedy that lurked over it all&mdash;the embarrassed
manner in which Lamo&#8217;s citizens complied with the
command, and the spectacle they presented afterward.
</p>
<p>Deveny&#8217;s hands were the last to go up. There was
a coldly malignant glare in his eyes as under Harlan&#8217;s
unwavering gaze he finally raised his hands and held
them, palms outward, as for inspection.
</p>
<p>Rogers had complied instantly. There was a smile
on his face, faint and suggestive of grim amusement,
for he had been mentally tortured over the contemplation
of Barbara&#8217;s predicament, and had been unable
to think of any plan by which he might assist her.
</p>
<p>Meeder Lawson&#8217;s face was sullen and full of impotent
rage, and he watched Deveny with a gaze of
bitter accusation when he saw that the big man intended
to obey Harlan&#8217;s order. Barbara&#8217;s pursuer,
having felt Deveny&#8217;s angry gaze upon him, and being
uncomfortably conscious that Harlan had not forgotten
him, was red of face and self-conscious. He
started, and the red in his face deepened, when Harlan,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
in the silence which followed the concerted raising of
hands, spoke sharply to him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What was you tryin&#8217; to corral that girl for? Talk
fast or I&#8217;ll bust you wide open!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man grinned foolishly, shooting a furtive glance
at Deveny.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, noting Deveny&#8217;s scowl, &#8220;I reckon
it was because I&#8217;d took a shine to her. I was tryin&#8217; to
cotton up to her on the landin&#8217; about the Eatin&#8217;-House,
an&#8217; she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was Barbara. Pale, her eyes flashing with
indignation, she stepped down into the street, standing
near Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That man,&#8221; Barbara went on, pointing to the red-faced
pursuer, &#8220;told me early this morning that Luke
Deveny had told him to watch me, that I was not to
leave my room until Deveny came for me. I was a
prisoner. He didn&#8217;t try to make love to me. I should
have killed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Speech had broken the tension under which Barbara
had been laboring; the flow of words through her lips
stimulated her thoughts and sent them skittering back
to the salient incidents of her enforced confinement;
they brought into her consciousness a recollection of
the conversation she had heard between Meeder Lawson
and Strom Rogers, regarding her father. She forgot
Harlan, Deveny, and the others, and ran to Sheriff
Gage.
</p>
<p>Gage, a tall, slender man of forty, was pale and uncomfortable
as he looked down at the girl&#8217;s white, upturned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
face. He shrank from the frenzied appeal of
her eyes, and he endured the pain of her tightly gripping
fingers on the flesh of his arms without flinching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;is father <i>dead</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She waited, frantically shaking Gage. And Gage
did not answer until his gaze had roamed the crowd.
</p>
<p>Then he said slowly and reluctantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he&#8217;s dead. Deveny was tellin&#8217; me&mdash;he
was chargin&#8217; this man, Harlan, with killin&#8217; your
father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara wheeled and faced Deveny. Rage, furious
and passionate, had overwhelmed the grief she felt
over the death of her father. The shock had been
tremendous, but it had come while she had been leaning
out of the window listening to Rogers and Lawson&mdash;when
she had lain for many minutes unconscious
on the floor of the room. Therefore the emotion she
experienced now was not entirely grief, it was rather
a frantic yearning to punish the men who had killed
her father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You charged this man with murdering my
father?&#8221; she demanded of Deveny as she walked to
him and stood, her hands clenched, her face dead
white and her eyes blazing hate. &#8220;You know better.
I heard Strom Rogers tell Meeder Lawson that it was
Dolver and Laskar and somebody he called the
&#8216;Chief,&#8217; who did it. I want to know who those men
are; I want to know where I can find them! I want
you to tell me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re unstrung, Barbara,&#8221; said Deveny slowly,
coolly, a faint smile on his face. &#8220;I know nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
about it. I merely repeated to Gage the word Laskar
brought. Laskar said this man Harlan shot your
father. It happened about a day&#8217;s ride out&mdash;near
Sentinel Rock. If Laskar lied, he was paid for his
lying. For Harlan has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny paused, the sentence unfinished, for the girl
turned abruptly from him and walked to Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Laskar&mdash;the man you killed just now?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Laskar an&#8217; Dolver,&#8221; relied Harlan. &#8220;There was
three of them your father said. One got away in the
night, leavin&#8217; Dolver an&#8217; Laskar to finish the job. I
run plumb into them, crossin&#8217; here from Pardo. I
bored Dolver, but I let Laskar off, not havin&#8217; the
heart to muss up the desert with scum like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes gleamed for an instant with venomous
satisfaction. Then she said, tremulously:
</p>
<p>&#8220;And father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I buried him near the rock,&#8221; returned Harlan,
lowly.
</p>
<p>Soundlessly, closing her eyes, Barbara sank into the
dust of the street.
</p>
<p>Harlan broke the force of her fall with his left
hand, supporting her partially until she collapsed; then,
his eyes alight with a cold flame, he called, sharply,
his gaze still on the group of men:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get her, Gage! Take her into your place!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He waited until Gage carried the slack form inside.
Then, his shoulders sagging, the heavy pistol in his
right hand coming to a poise, the fingers of the left
hand brushing the butt of the weapon in the holster
at his left hip, the vacuous gleam in his eyes telling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
them all that his senses were alert to catch the slightest
movement, he spoke, to Deveny:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I seen that desert deal. It wasn&#8217;t on the level. I
ain&#8217;t no angel, but when I down a man I do it fair an&#8217;
square&mdash;givin&#8217; him his chance. I sent that sneak Dolver
out&mdash;an&#8217; that coyote Laskar. It was a dirty,
rotten deal, the way they framed up on Morgan. It&#8217;s
irritated me&mdash;I reckon you can hear my rattles right
now. I&#8217;m stayin&#8217; in Lamo, an&#8217; I&#8217;m stickin&#8217; by this Barbara
girl until you guys learn to walk straight up, like
men!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He paused, and a heavy silence descended. No man
moved. A sneer began to wreathe Harlan&#8217;s lips&mdash;a
twisting, mocking, sardonic sneer that expressed his
contempt for the men who faced him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not havin&#8217; any thoughts, eh?&#8221; he jeered.
&#8220;There&#8217;s some guys that would rather do their fightin&#8217;
with women, an&#8217; their thoughts wouldn&#8217;t sound right
if they put words around them. I ain&#8217;t detainin&#8217; you
no longer. Any man who thinks it&#8217;s time to call for
a show-down can do his yappin&#8217; right now. Them
that&#8217;s dead certain they&#8217;re through can mosey along,
takin&#8217; care not to try any monkey business!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood, watching, his wide gaze including them
all, until, one after another the men in the group
silently moved away. They did not go far. Some of
them merely stepped into near-by doorways, others
sauntered slowly down the street and halted at a little
distance to look back.
</p>
<p>But no man made a hostile move, for they had seen
the tragedy in which Laskar had figured, and they had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
no desire to provoke Harlan to express again the cold
wrath that slumbered in his eyes.
</p>
<p>Meeder Lawson was the first of Deveny&#8217;s intimates
to leave the group. His face sullen, his eyes venomous,
he walked across the street to the First Chance,
and stood in the doorway, beside Balleau, who had
been an interested onlooker.
</p>
<p>Then Strom Rogers moved. He wheeled slowly,
flashing an inquiring glance at Deveny&mdash;who still
stood motionless. Deveny had lowered his hands&mdash;they
were hanging at his sides, the right hand having
the palm toward Harlan, giving eloquent testimony
of its owner&#8217;s peaceable intentions.
</p>
<p>Rogers&#8217; glance included the out-turned palm, and his
lips curved in a faint smile. The smile held as his
glance went to Harlan&#8217;s face, and for an instant as the
eyes of the two men met, appraisal was the emotion
that ruled in them. Harlan detected in Rogers&#8217; eyes
a grim scorn of Deveny, and a malignant satisfaction;
Rogers saw in Harlan&#8217;s eyes a thing that not one of
the men who had faced the man had seen&mdash;cold
humor.
</p>
<p>Then Rogers was walking away, leaving Deveny to
face the man who had disrupted his plans.
</p>
<p>Deveny had not changed his position, and for an instant
following the departure of Rogers, there was no
word spoken. Then for the first time since he had
dismounted from Purgatory, Harlan&#8217;s eyes lost their
wide, inclusive vacuity. They met Deveny&#8217;s fairly,
with a steady, direct, boring intensity; a light in them
that resembled the yellow flame that Deveny had once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
seen in the eyes of a Mexican jaguar some year before
at a camp on the Neuces.
</p>
<p>Deveny knew what the light in Harlan&#8217;s eyes meant.
It meant the presence of a wild, rending passion, of
elemental impulses; it meant that the man who faced
him was eager to kill him, was awaiting his slightest
hostile movement. It meant more. The gleam in Harlan&#8217;s
eyes indicated that the man possessed that strange
and almost uncanny instinct of thought reading, that
he could detect in another&#8217;s eyes a mental impulse before
the other&#8217;s muscles could answer it. Also, it meant
certain death to Deveny should he obey the half-formed
determination to draw and shoot, that was in
his mind at this instant.
</p>
<p>He dropped his lids, attempting to veil the thought
from Harlan. But when he again looked up it was to
see Harlan&#8217;s lips twisting into a cold smile&mdash;to see
Harlan slowly sheathing the gun he had held in his
right hand.
</p>
<p>And now Harlan was standing before him, both
weapons in their holsters. He and Deveny were facing
each other upon a basis of equality. Harlan had disdained
taking advantage.
</p>
<p>Apparently, if Deveny now elected to draw and
shoot, his chances were as good as Harlan&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>And yet Deveny knew they were not as good. For
Harlan&#8217;s action in sheathing his gun convinced Deveny
that the man had divined his thoughts from the expression
of his eyes before he had veiled them with
the lids, and he was convinced that Harlan had sensed
the chill of dread that had swept over him at that instant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
He was sure of it when he heard Harlan&#8217;s
voice, low and taunting:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You waitin&#8217; for a show-down?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny smiled, pallidly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you
that I <i>did</i> have a notion that way a moment ago. But
I was afraid I might be a little slow. When you
downed Laskar I watched you, trying to learn the
secret of your draw. I didn&#8217;t learn it, because there is
no secret&mdash;you&#8217;re just a natural gunslinger without a
flaw. You&#8217;re the fastest man with a gun I ever saw&mdash;and
I&#8217;m taking my hat off to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan smiled faintly, but his eyes did not lose their
alertness, nor did the flame in them cool visibly. Only
his lips betrayed whatever emotion he felt. He distrusted
Deveny, for he had seen the half-formed determination
in the man&#8217;s eyes, and his muscles were
tensed in anticipation of a trick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t stay here to tell me that. Get goin&#8217;
with the real talk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&mdash;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Deveny. He was
cool, now, and bland, having recovered his poise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Higgins <i>was</i> watching Barbara Morgan at my orders.
But I meant no harm to the girl. I knew she
was in town, and I heard there were a few of the boys
that were making plans about her. So I set Higgins
to guard her. Naturally, she thought I meant harm
to her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; said Harlan.
</p>
<p>Deveny said coolly: &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit I have a bad reputation.
But it doesn&#8217;t run to women. It&#8217;s more in
your line.&#8221; He looked significantly at the other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell&mdash;you know well enough what I mean.
You&#8217;re not such a law-abiding citizen, yourself. I&#8217;ve
heard of you&mdash;often. And I&#8217;ve admired you. To
get right down to the point&mdash;I could find a place
where you&#8217;d fit in just right. We&#8217;re needing another
man&mdash;a man of your general size and character.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;m thankin&#8217; you. An&#8217; I sure
appreciate what you&#8217;ve said. You&#8217;ve been likin&#8217; me
so much that you tried to frame up on me about sendin&#8217;
Lane Morgan out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s business,&#8221; laughed Deveny. &#8220;You were
an unknown quantity, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But not now&mdash;eh?&#8221; returned Harlan, his eyes
gleaming with a cold humor. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got me sized
up right. The yappin&#8217; I done about stickin&#8217; to Barbara
Morgan wasn&#8217;t the real goods, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; laughed Deveny, &#8220;there must be
some selfish motive behind that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you sure didn&#8217;t believe me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; chuckled Deveny, for he thought
he saw a gleam of insincerity in Harlan&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ve got to do my yappin&#8217; all over again,&#8221;
said Harlan. &#8220;Now get this straight. I&#8217;m stickin&#8217; to
Barbara Morgan. I&#8217;m runnin&#8217; the Rancho Seco from
now on. I&#8217;m runnin&#8217; it <i>my</i> way. Nobody is botherin&#8217;
Barbara Morgan except them guys she wants to have
bother her. That lets you out. You&#8217;re a rank coyote,
an&#8217; I don&#8217;t have no truck with you except at the business
end of a gun. Now take your damned, sneakin&#8217;
grin over an&#8217; wet it down, or I&#8217;ll blow you apart!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>Deveny&#8217;s face changed color. It became bloated
with a poisonous wrath, his eyes gleamed evilly and his
muscles tensed. He stood, straining against the murder
lust that had seized him, almost persuaded to take
the slender chance of beating Harlan to his weapon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got notions, eh?&#8221; he heard Harlan say, jeeringly.
&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t spoil &#8217;em. I&#8217;d admire to make
you feel like you&#8217;d ought to have got started a week
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny smiled with hideous mirthlessness. But he
again caught the flame in Harlan&#8217;s eyes. He wheeled,
saying nothing more, and walked across the street without
looking back.
</p>
<p>Smiles followed him; several men commented
humorously, and almost immediately, knowing that
this last crisis had passed, Lamo&#8217;s citizens resumed
their interrupted pleasures.
</p>
<p>Harlan stood motionless until Deveny vanished into
the First Chance, then he turned quickly and entered
the sheriff&#8217;s office.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>BARBARA IS PUZZLED</h3>
</div>

<p>Half an hour later, with Barbara Morgan, on
&#8220;Billy&#8221;&mdash;a piebald pinto&mdash;riding beside him,
Harlan loped Purgatory out of Lamo. They took a
trail&mdash;faint and narrow&mdash;that led southward, for
Barbara had said that the Rancho Seco lay in that
direction.
</p>
<p>Harlan had not seen Deveny or Rogers or Lawson
after the scene in front of the sheriff&#8217;s office. He had
talked for some time with Gage, waiting until Barbara
Morgan recovered slightly from the shock she had
suffered. Then when he had told her that he intended
to accompany her to the Rancho Seco&mdash;and she had
offered no objection&mdash;he had gone on a quest for her
pony, finding him in the stable in the rear of the
Eating-House.
</p>
<p>So far as Harlan knew, no one in Lamo besides
Sheriff Gage had watched the departure of himself
and Barbara. And there had been no word spoken
between the two as they rode away&mdash;Lamo becoming
at last an almost invisible dot in the great yawning
space they left behind them.
</p>
<p>Barbara felt a curious unconcern for what was happening;
her brain was in a state of dull apathy, resulting
from shock and the period of dread under which
she had lived for more than a day and a night.
</p>
<p>She did not seem to care what happened to her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
She knew, to be sure, that she was riding toward the
Rancho Seco with a man whom she had heard called
an outlaw by other men; she was aware that she must
be risking something by accepting his escort&mdash;and yet
she could not bring herself to feel that dread fear that
she knew any young woman in her position should feel.
</p>
<p>It seemed to her that nothing mattered now&mdash;very
much. Her father was dead&mdash;murdered by some
men&mdash;two of whom had been punished by death, and
another&mdash;a mysterious person called the &#8220;Chief&#8221;&mdash;who
would be killed as soon as she could find him.
That resolution was deeply fixed in her mind.
</p>
<p>Her gaze though, after a while, went to Harlan,
and for many miles she studied him without his suspecting.
And gradually she began to think about him,
to wonder why he had protected her from the man,
Higgins, and why he was going with her to the Rancho
Seco.
</p>
<p>She provided&mdash;after a while&mdash;an answer to her
first question: He had protected her because she had
run into his arms in her effort to escape the clutches of
the man who had pursued her&mdash;Higgins. She remembered
that while she had been at the window,
watching Harlan when he had dismounted in front of
the sheriff&#8217;s office, he had seemed to make a favorable
impression upon her.
</p>
<p>That was the reason, when she had seen him before
her in the street, after he had shot Laskar, she had
selected him as a protector. That had seemed to be
the logical thing to do, for he had arrayed himself
against her enemies in killing Laskar, and it was reasonable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
to suppose&mdash;conceding Laskar and Higgins
were leagued with Deveny&mdash;that Harlan would protect
her.
</p>
<p>It all seemed exceedingly natural, that far. It was
when she began to wonder why Harlan was with her
now that an element of mystery seemed to rule. And
she was puzzled.
</p>
<p>She began to speculate over Harlan, and her mental
efforts in that direction banished the somber thoughts
that had almost overwhelmed her after the discovery
of her father&#8217;s death. Yet they had ridden more than
ten miles before she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you decide to ride with me to the
Rancho Seco?&#8221; she demanded sharply.
</p>
<p>Harlan flashed a grin at her. He was riding a little
in advance of her, and he had to turn in the saddle to
see her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was headin&#8217; that way, an&#8217; wanted company. It
sure gets lonesome ridin&#8217; alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She caught her breath at this answer, for it seemed
that he had not revealed the real reason. And she had
got her first good look at his face. It was lean and
strong. His eyes were deep-set and rimmed by heavy
lashes and brows, and there was a glow in them as he
looked at her&mdash;a compelling fixity that held her. Her
own drooped, and were lifted to his again in sheer
curiosity, she thought at first.
</p>
<p>It was only when she found herself, later, trying to
catch his glance again that she realized they were magnetic
eyes, and that the glow in them was of a subtle
quality that could not be analyzed at a glance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>The girl was alert to detect a certain expression in
his eyes&mdash;a gleam that would tell her what she half
feared&mdash;that the motive that had brought him with
her was like that which had caused Deveny to hold her
captive. But she could detect no such expression in
Harlan&#8217;s eyes, she could see a quizzical humor in his
glances at times, or frank interest, and there were
times when she saw a grim pity.
</p>
<p>And the pity affected her strangely. It brought him
close to her&mdash;figuratively; it convinced her that he was
a man of warm sympathies in spite of the reputation
he held in the Territory.
</p>
<p>She had heard her father speak of him&mdash;always
with a sort of awe in his voice; and tales of his reckless
daring, his Satanic cleverness with a six-shooter, of his
ruthlessness, had reached her ears from other sources.
He had seemed, then, like some evil character of mythology,
remote and far, and not likely to appear in the
flesh in her section of the country.
</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that she had fled to such a man
for protection&mdash;and that he had protected her; and
that she was now riding beside him&mdash;or slightly behind
him&mdash;and that, to all appearances, he was quite
as respectful toward her as other men. That, she surmised,
was what made it all seem so strange.
</p>
<p>Harlan did not seem disposed to talk; and he kept
Purgatory slightly in the lead&mdash;except when the trail
grew dim or disappeared altogether. Then he would
pull the black horse up, look inquiringly at Barbara,
and urge Purgatory after her when she took the lead.
</p>
<p>But there were many things that Barbara wanted to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
inquire about; and it was when they were crossing a
big level between some rimming hills, where the trail
was broad, that she urged her pony beside the black.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me about father&mdash;how he died?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>He looked sharply at her, saw that she was now
quite composed, and drawing Purgatory to a walk, began
to relate to her the incident of the fight at Sentinel
Rock. His story was brief&mdash;brutally brief, she might
have thought, had she not been watching his face during
the telling, noting the rage that flamed in his eyes
when he spoke of Dolver and Laskar and the mysterious
&#8220;Chief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was plain to the girl that he had sympathized
with her father; and it was quite as plain that he now
sympathized with her. And thus she mentally recorded
another point in his favor:
</p>
<p>He might be a gunman, a ruthless killer, an outlaw
of such evil reputation that men mentioned his name
with awe in their voices&mdash;but she <i>knew</i>, now, that he
had a keen sense of justice, and that the murder of her
father had aroused the retributive instinct in him.
</p>
<p>Also, she was convinced that compared to Deveny,
Rogers, and Lawson, he was a gentleman. At least,
so far he had not looked at her as those men had
looked at her. He had been with her now for several
hours, in a lonely country where there was no law
except his own desires, and he had been as gravely
courteous and considerate as it was possible for any
man to be.
</p>
<p>When he finished his story, having neglected to mention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the paper he had removed from one of the cylinders
of Morgan&#8217;s pistol&mdash;upon which was written instructions
regarding the location of the gold Morgan
had secreted&mdash;Barbara rode for a long time in silence,
her head bowed, her eyes moist.
</p>
<p>At last she looked up. Harlan&#8217;s gaze was straight
ahead; he was watching the trail, where it vanished
over the crest of a high ridge, and he did not seem to
be aware of Barbara&#8217;s presence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And father told you to tell me&mdash;wanted you to
bring the news to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she went on &#8220;your obligation&mdash;if you
were under any&mdash;seems to have been completed. You
need not have come out of your way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was headed this way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To the Rancho Seco?&#8221; she questioned, astonished.
</p>
<p>Again he nodded. But this time there was a slight
smile on his lips.
</p>
<p>Her own straightened, and her eyes glowed with a
sudden suspicion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s odd,&#8221; she said; &#8220;very odd.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That you should be on your way to the Rancho
Seco&mdash;and that you should encounter father&mdash;that
you should happen to reach Sentinel Rock about the
time he was murdered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked straight at her, noting the suspicion in
her eyes. His low laugh had a hint of irony in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of such things,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About guys happenin&#8217; to run plumb into a murder
when they was innocent of it&mdash;an&#8217; of them bein&#8217; accused
of the murder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the mocking light in his eyes that angered
her, she believed&mdash;and the knowledge that he had
been aware of her suspicion before it had become half
formed in her mind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not accusing you!&#8221; she declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it was odd that I&#8217;d be headed this way&mdash;after
I&#8217;d told you all there was to tell.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; she maintained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he conceded; &#8220;mebbe it&#8217;s odd. But I&#8217;m
still headin&#8217; for the Rancho Seco. Mebbe I forgot to
tell you that your father said I was to go&mdash;that he
made me promise to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had not mentioned that before; and the girl
glanced sharply at him. He met the glance with a
slow grin which had in it a quality of that subtleness
she had noticed in him before. A shiver of trepidation
ran over her. But she sat rigid in the saddle, determined
she would not be afraid of him. For the
exchange of talk between them, and his considerate
manner&mdash;everything about him&mdash;had convinced her
that he was much like other men&mdash;men who respect
women.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no evidence that father made you promise
to go to the Rancho Seco.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t no evidence that I made any promise
to keep that man Deveny from herd-ridin&#8217; you,&#8221; he
said shortly, with a grin. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure goin&#8217; to the
Rancho Seco.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I should not wish it&mdash;what then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d keep right on headin&#8217; for there&mdash;keepin&#8217; my
promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you always keep your promises?&#8221; she asked,
mockery in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I make &#8217;em. Usually, I don&#8217;t do any promisin&#8217;.
But when I do&mdash;that promise is goin&#8217; to be
kept. If you ain&#8217;t likin&#8217; my company, ma&#8217;am, why, I
reckon there&#8217;s a heap of trail ahead. An&#8217; I ain&#8217;t afraid
of gettin&#8217; lost.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that remarkable!&#8221; she jeered.
</p>
<p>He looked at her with sober eyes. &#8220;If we&#8217;re
figurin&#8217; on hittin&#8217; the Rancho Seco before night we&#8217;ll
have to quit our gassin&#8217; an&#8217; do some travelin&#8217;,&#8221; he advised.
&#8220;Accordin&#8217; to the figures we&#8217;ve got about forty
miles to ride, altogether. We&#8217;ve come about fifteen&mdash;an&#8217;,&#8221;
he looked at a silver watch which he drew
from a pocket, &#8220;it&#8217;s pretty near two now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Without further words&mdash;for it seemed useless to
argue the point upon which he was so obviously determined&mdash;Barbara
urged Billy on, taking the lead.
</p>
<p>For more than an hour she maintained the lead,
riding a short distance in advance, and seemingly paying
no attention to Harlan. Yet she noted that he
kept about the same distance from her always&mdash;though
she never permitted him to observe that she
watched him, for her backward glances were taken
out of the corners of her eyes, when she pretended to
be looking at the country on one side or the other.
</p>
<p>Harlan, however, noted the glances. And his lips
curved into a faint grin as he rode. Once when he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
had dropped behind a little farther than usual, he
leaned over and whispered into Purgatory&#8217;s ear:
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s sure ignorin&#8217; us, ain&#8217;t she, you black son-of-a-gun!
She ain&#8217;t looked back here more&#8217;n three times
in the last five minutes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And yet Harlan&#8217;s jocular mood did not endure long.
During those intervals in which Barbara kept her gaze
straight ahead on the trail, Harlan regarded her with
a grave intentness that betrayed the soberness of his
thoughts.
</p>
<p>In all his days he had seen no woman like her;
and when she had come toward him in Lamo, with
Higgins close behind her, he had been so astonished
that he had momentarily forgotten Deveny and all the
rest of them.
</p>
<p>Women of the kind he had met had never affected
him as Barbara had affected him. He had still a
mental picture of her as she had come toward him,
with her hair flying in a golden-brown mass over her
shoulders; her wide, fear-lighted eyes seeking his with
an expression of appeal so eloquent that it had sent a
queer, thrilling, protective sensation over him.
</p>
<p>And as she rode ahead of him it was the picture she
had made <i>then</i> that he saw; and the emotions that
assailed him were the identical emotions that had beset
him when for a brief instant, in Lamo, he had held
her in his arms, with her head resting on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>That, he felt, had been the real Barbara Morgan.
Her manner now&mdash;the constrained and distant pose
she had adopted, her suspicions, her indignation&mdash;all
those were outward manifestations of the reaction that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
had seized her. The real Barbara Morgan was she
who had run to him for protection and she would always
be to him as she had appeared then&mdash;a soft,
yielding, trembling girl who, at a glance had trusted
him enough to run straight into his arms.

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>AN UNWELCOME GUEST</h3>
</div>

<p>It was late afternoon when Barbara and Harlan&mdash;the
girl still riding a little in advance of the man&mdash;rode
their horses out of a stretch of broken country
featured by low, barren hills and ragged draws, and
came to the edge of a vast level of sage and mesquite
that stretched southward an interminable distance.
</p>
<p>The sun was low&mdash;a flaming red disk that swam in
a sea of ever-changing color between the towering
peaks of two mighty mountains miles westward&mdash;and
the sky above the big level upon which Barbara and
Harlan rode was a pale amethyst set in the dull gray
frame of the dusk that was rising from the southern
and eastern horizons.
</p>
<p>Eastward the gray was pierced by the burning, flaming
prismatic streaks that stretched straight from the
cleft in the mountains where the sun was sinking&mdash;the
sun seemed to be sending floods of new color into the
streaks as he went, deepening those that remained;
tinging it all with harmonious tones&mdash;rose and pearl
and violet and saffron blending them with a giant,
magic brush&mdash;recreating them, making the whole
background of amethyst sky glow like a huge jewel
touched by the myriad colors of a mighty rainbow.
</p>
<p>The trail taken by Barbara Morgan ran now, in a
southeasterly direction, and it seemed to Harlan that
they were riding straight into the folds of a curtain of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
gauze. For a haze was rising into the effulgent expanse
of color, and the sun&#8217;s rays, striking it, wrought
their magic upon it.
</p>
<p>Harlan, accustomed to sunsets&mdash;with a matter-of-fact
attitude toward all of nature&#8217;s phenomena&mdash;caught
himself admiring this one. So intent was he
that he looked around with a start when Purgatory
halted, to find that Barbara had drawn Billy down and
was sitting in the saddle close to him, watching him,
her eyes luminous with an emotion that thrilled Harlan
strangely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the most beautiful place in the world,&#8221; she
declared in a voice that seemed to quaver with awe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure a beauty,&#8221; agreed Harlan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in
a heap of places where they had sunsets, but dump &#8217;em
all together an&#8217; they wouldn&#8217;t make an edge on this
display. She&#8217;s sure a hummer!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes seemed to leap at his praise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never want to leave this place,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There
is nothing like it. Those two mountains that you see
far out into the west&mdash;where the sun is going down&mdash;are
about forty miles distant. If you will notice, you
can see that there are other mountains&mdash;much smaller&mdash;connected
with them. They are two small ranges,
and they melt into the plains there&mdash;and there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She pointed to the south and to the north, where
the two ranges, seemingly extending straight westward,
merged into the edge of the big level where
Barbara and Harlan sat on their horses.
</p>
<p>The two ranges were perhaps a dozen miles apart,
separated by a low level valley through which ran a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
narrow river, its surface glowing like burnished gold
in the rays of the sinking sun.
</p>
<p>Gazing westward&mdash;straight into the glow&mdash;Harlan
noted the virgin wildness of the immense valley.
It lay, serene, slumberous; its salient features&mdash;ridges,
low hills, rocky promontories and wooded slopes&mdash;touched
by the rose tints that descended upon them;
while in the depressions reigned purple shadows, soft-toned,
blending perfectly with the brighter colors.
</p>
<p>With the sunset glow upon it; with the bastioned
hills&mdash;barren at their peaks, ridged and seamed&mdash;looming
clear and definite above the vast expanse of
green, the colossal valley stretched, with no movement
in it or above it&mdash;in a vacuum-like stillness that might
have reigned over the world on the dawn of creation&#8217;s
first morning.
</p>
<p>Harlan looked covertly at Barbara. The girl&#8217;s face
was pale, and her eyes were glowing with a light that
made him draw a long breath of sympathy and understanding.
But it had been many years since he had
felt the thrill of awe that she was experiencing at this
minute.
</p>
<p>He knew that presently the spell would pass, and
that material things would exact their due. And the
resulting contrast between the beauty of the picture
upon which she was gazing, and the solemn realization
of loss that memory would bring, instantly, would almost
crush her.
</p>
<p>Therefore he spoke seriously when he caught her
looking at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s sunsets <i>an&#8217;</i> sunsets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They tell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
me that they&#8217;re a heap common in some parts of the
world. Wyoming, now&mdash;Wyoming prides herself on
sunsets. An&#8217; I&#8217;ve heard they have &#8217;em in Italy, an&#8217;
France&mdash;an&#8217; some more of them foreign places&mdash;where
guys go to look at &#8217;em. But it&#8217;s always seemed
to me that there ain&#8217;t a heap of sense in gettin&#8217; fussed
up over a sunset. The sun has got his work to do; an&#8217;
he does it without any fussin&#8217;. An&#8217; they tell me that
it&#8217;s the same sun that sets in all them places I&#8217;ve been
tellin&#8217; you about.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s always been my idee that the sun ain&#8217;t
got no compliments due him&mdash;he&#8217;ll set mighty beautiful&mdash;sometimes;
an&#8217; folks will get awed an&#8217; thrilly
over him. But the next day&mdash;if a man happens to be
ridin&#8217; in the desert, where there ain&#8217;t any water, he&#8217;ll
cuss the sun pretty thorough&mdash;forgettin&#8217; the nice
things he said about it once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara scowled at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t a bit of poetry in your soul!&#8221; she
charged. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry we stopped to look at the valley
or the sun&mdash;or anything. You don&#8217;t&mdash;you can&#8217;t appreciate
the beautiful!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent as she urged Billy onward. And
as they fled southwestward, with Purgatory far behind,
Harlan swept his hat from his head and bowed toward
the mighty valley, saying lowly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure a hummer&mdash;an&#8217; no mistake. But if
a man had any poetry in his soul&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rode on, gulping his delight over having accomplished
what he had intended to accomplish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be givin&#8217; it to me pretty regular; an&#8217; she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
won&#8217;t have time for no solemn thoughts. They&#8217;ll come
later, though, when she gets to the Rancho Seco.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was the lowing of cattle that at last brought to
Harlan the conviction that they were near the Rancho
Seco&mdash;that and the sight of the roofs of some buildings
that presently came into view.
</p>
<p>But they had been riding for half an hour before
they came upon the cattle and buildings, and the flaming
colors had faded into somber gray tones. The
filmy dusk that precedes darkness was beginning to settle
over the land; and into the atmosphere had come
that solemn hush with which the wide, open places
greet the night.
</p>
<p>Barbara had no further word to say to Harlan until
they reached a group of buildings that were scattered
on a big level near a river. They had passed a long
stretch of wire fence, which Harlan suspected, enclosed
a section of land reserved for a pasture; and the girl
brought her pony to a halt in front of an adobe building
near a high rail fence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Rancho Seco,&#8221; she said shortly. &#8220;This
is the stable. Over there is the ranchhouse. Evidently
the men are all away somewhere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She got off the pony, removed the saddle and bridle,
carried them into the stable, came out again, and
opened a gate in the fence, through which she sent
&#8220;Billy.&#8221; Then she closed the gate and turned to Harlan,
who had dismounted and was standing at Purgatory&#8217;s
head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you for what you have done for me,&#8221; she
said, coldly. &#8220;And now, I should like to know just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
what you purpose to do&mdash;and why you have come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s eyes narrowed as he returned her gaze.
He remembered Lane Morgan&#8217;s words: &#8220;John Haydon
is dead stuck on Barbara;&#8221; and he had wondered
ever since the meeting in Lamo if Barbara returned
Haydon&#8217;s affection, or if she trusted Haydon enough
to confide in him.
</p>
<p>Barbara&#8217;s attitude toward Haydon would affect
Harlan&#8217;s attitude toward the girl. For if she loved
Haydon, or trusted him enough to confide in him&mdash;or
even to communicate with him concerning ordinary details,
Harlan could not apprise her of the significance
of his presence at the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>For Haydon was unknown to Harlan and Harlan
was not inclined to accept Morgan&#8217;s praise of him as
conclusive evidence of the man&#8217;s worthiness. Besides,
Morgan had qualified his instructions with: &#8220;Take
a look at John Haydon, an&#8217; if you think he&#8217;s on the
level&mdash;an&#8217; you want to drift on&mdash;turn things over
to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan did not want to &#8220;drift on.&#8221; Into his heart
since his meeting in Lamo with Barbara&mdash;and during
the ride to the Rancho Seco&mdash;had grown a decided
reluctance toward &#8220;drifting.&#8221; And not even the girl&#8217;s
scorn could have forced him to leave her at the ranch,
unprotected.
</p>
<p>But he could not tell her why he could not go. Despite
her protests he must remain&mdash;at least until he
was able to determine the character of John Haydon.
</p>
<p>A gleam of faint mockery came into his eyes as he
looked at Barbara.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m keepin&#8217; my promise to your dad&mdash;I&#8217;m stayin&#8217;
at the Rancho Seco because he told me to stay. He
wanted me to sort of look out that nothin&#8217; happened to
you. I reckon we&#8217;ll get along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl caught her breath sharply. In the growing
darkness Harlan&#8217;s smile seemed to hold an evil significance;
it seemed to express a thought that took into
consideration the loneliness of the surroundings, the
fact that she was alone, and that she was helpless.
More&mdash;it seemed to be a presumptuous smile, insinuating,
full of dire promise.
</p>
<p>For Harlan was an outlaw&mdash;she could not forget
that! He bore a reputation for evil that had made
him feared wherever men congregated; and as she
watched him it seemed to her that his face betrayed
signs of his ruthlessness, his recklessness, and his readiness
for violence of every kind.
</p>
<p>He might not have killed her father&mdash;Rogers and
Lawson had acquitted him of that. But he might be
lying about the promise to her father merely for the
purpose of providing an excuse to come to the Rancho
Seco. It seemed to her that if her father had really
exacted a promise from him he would have written to
her, or sent her some token to prove the genuineness
of it. There was no visible evidence of Harlan&#8217;s truthfulness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say you are going to stay here&mdash;indefinitely?&#8221;
she demanded, her voice a little hoarse
from the fright that was stealing over her.
</p>
<p>He smiled at her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it about right,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to stay here!&#8221; she declared,
angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m stayin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; His smile faded, and his
eyes became serious&mdash;earnest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Later on&mdash;when things shape themselves up&mdash;I&#8217;ll
tell you why I&#8217;m stayin&#8217;. But just now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>She shrank from him, incredulous, a growing fear
plain in her eyes. And before he could finish what he
intended to say she had wheeled, and was running toward
the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>He watched until she vanished through an open
doorway; he heard the door slam, and caught the
sound of bars being hurriedly dropped into place. And
after that he stood for a time watching the house. No
light came from within, and no other sound.
</p>
<p>He frowned slightly, drawing a mental picture of
the girl inside, yielding to the terror that had seized
her. Then after a while he walked down along the
corral fence until he came to another building&mdash;a
bunkhouse. And for a long time he stood in the doorway
of the building, watching the ranchhouse, afflicted
with grim sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t so damn&#8217; cheerful, at that,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;I
reckon she thinks she&#8217;s landed into trouble with both
feet&mdash;with her dad cashin&#8217; in like he did, an&#8217; Deveny
after her. It sure must be pretty hard to consider all
them things. An&#8217; on top of that I mosey along, with
a reputation as a no-good son-of-a-gun, an&#8217; scare the
wits out of her with my homely mug. An&#8217; I can&#8217;t tell
her why she hadn&#8217;t ought to be scared. I call that
mighty mean.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>ON GUARD</h3>
</div>

<p>The man whose soul held no love of the poetic
sat for two or three hours on the threshold of
the bunkhouse door, his gaze on the ranchhouse. He
was considering his &#8220;reputation,&#8221; and he had reached
the conclusion that Barbara Morgan had reason to
fear him&mdash;if rumor&#8217;s tongues had related to her all
of the crimes that had been attributed to him. And he
knew she must have heard a great many tales about
him, for rumor is a tireless worker.
</p>
<p>And for the first time in his life Harlan regretted
that he had permitted rumor to weave her fabric of
lies. For not one of the stories that luridly portrayed
him in the rôle of a ruthless killer and outlaw was true.
</p>
<p>It was easy enough for him to understand how he
had gained that reputation. He grinned mirthlessly
now, as he mentally reviewed a past which <i>had</i> been
rather like the record of a professional man-killer.
And yet, reviewing his past&mdash;from the day about five
years ago, when he had shot a Taos bully who had
drawn a gun on him with murderous intent, until today,
when he had sent Laskar to his death&mdash;he could not
remember one shooting affray for which he could be
blamed. As a matter of fact, he had&mdash;by the courts
in some instances, and by witnesses in others, where
there were no courts&mdash;been held blameless.
</p>
<p>There had been men who had seen Harlan draw his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
weapons with deadly intent&mdash;men who insisted that
the man&#8217;s purpose was plain, to goad an enemy to draw
a weapon, permitting him partially to draw it, and
then to depend upon his superior swiftness and unerring
aim. And this theory of Harlan&#8217;s character
had gone abroad.
</p>
<p>And because the theory had been accepted, Harlan&#8217;s
name became associated with certain crimes which are
inseparable from the type of character which the popular
imagination had given him. Strangers&mdash;criminals&mdash;in
certain towns in the Territory and out of it must
have heard with considerable satisfaction that their
depredations had been charged to Harlan. Only once
had Harlan been able to refute the charge of rumor.
That was when, having passed a night in the company
of Dave Hallowell, the marshal of Pardo, word was
brought by a stage-driver that &#8220;Drag&#8221; Harlan had
killed a man in Dry Bottom&mdash;a town two hundred
miles north&mdash;and that Harlan had escaped, though a
posse had been on his trail.
</p>
<p>Even when the driver was confronted by Harlan in
the flesh he was doubtful, surrendering grudgingly, as
though half convinced that Harlan had been able to
transport himself over the distance from Dry Bottom
to Pardo by some magic not mentioned.
</p>
<p>So it had gone. But the terrible record of evil deeds
attributed to Harlan had not affected him greatly. In
the beginning&mdash;when he had killed the Taos bully&mdash;he
had been reluctant to take life; and he had avoided,
as much as possible, company in which he would be
forced to kill to protect himself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>And through it all he had been able to maintain his
poise, his self-control. The reputation he had achieved
would have ruined some men&mdash;would have filled them
with an ambition to fulfil the specifications of the
mythical terror men thought him. There was a danger
there; Harlan had felt it. There was a certain satisfaction
in being pointed out as a man with whom other
men dared not trifle; respect of a fearsome equality
was granted him&mdash;he had seen it in the eyes of men,
as he had seen an awed adulation in the eyes of
women.
</p>
<p>He had felt them all&mdash;all the emotions that a real
desperado could feel. He had experienced the impulse
to swagger, to pose&mdash;really to live the part that his
ill-fame had given him.
</p>
<p>But he had resisted those impulses; and the glow in
his eyes when in the presence of men who feared him
was not the passion to kill, but a humorous contempt
of all men who abased themselves before him.
</p>
<p>On the night he had been with Dave Hallowell, the
marshal of Pardo, he had listened with steady interest
to a story told him by the latter. It concerned the
Lamo region and the great basin at which he and
Barbara Morgan had been looking when the girl had
accused him of a lack of poetic feeling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard reports about Sunset Valley,&#8221; Hallowell
had said, squinting his eyes at Harlan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve met
Sheriff Gage two or three times, an&#8217; he&#8217;s had somethin&#8217;
to say about it. Accordin&#8217; to Gage, everything ain&#8217;t
on the surface over there; there&#8217;s somethin&#8217; behind all
that robbin&#8217; an&#8217; stealin&#8217; that&#8217;s goin&#8217; on. There&#8217;s somethin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
big, but it&#8217;s hid&mdash;an&#8217; no man ain&#8217;t ever been able
to find out what it is. But it&#8217;s somethin&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, Deveny&#8217;s gang ain&#8217;t never been
heard of as pullin&#8217; off anything anywheres else but in
Sunset Valley. As for that, there&#8217;s plenty of room in
the valley for them without gettin&#8217; out of it. But it
seems they&#8217;d get out once in a while. They don&#8217;t&mdash;they
stay right in the valley, or close around it. Seems
to me they&#8217;ve got a grudge ag&#8217;in&#8217; them Sunset Valley
ranchers, an&#8217; are workin&#8217; it off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why? That question has got Gage guessin&#8217;. It&#8217;s
got everybody guessin&#8217;. Stock is bein&#8217; run off in big
bunches; men is bein&#8217; murdered without no cause; no
man is able to get any money in or out of the valley&mdash;an&#8217;
they&#8217;re doin&#8217; other things that is makin&#8217; the
cattlemen feel nervous an&#8217; flighty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve scared one man out&mdash;a Pole named
Launski&mdash;from the far end. He pulled stakes an&#8217;
hit the breeze runnin&#8217; sellin&#8217; out for a song to a guy
named Haydon. I seen Launski when he clumb on
the Lamo stage, headin&#8217; this way, an&#8217; he sure was a
heap relieved to get out with a whole skin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hallowell talked long, and the mystery that seemed
to surround Sunset Valley appealed to Harlan&#8217;s imagination.
Yet he did not reveal his interest to Hallowell
until the latter mentioned Barbara Morgan.
Then his eyes glowed, and he leaned closer to the
marshal.
</p>
<p>And when Hallowell remarked that Lane Morgan,
of the Rancho Seco had declared he would give half
his ranch to a trustworthy man who could be depended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
upon to &#8220;work his guns&#8221; in the interest of the Morgan
family, the slow tensing of Harlan&#8217;s muscles might
have betrayed the man&#8217;s emotions&mdash;for Hallowell
grinned faintly.
</p>
<p>Hallowell had said more. But he did not say that
word had come to him from Sheriff Gage&mdash;an appeal,
rather&mdash;to the effect that Morgan had sent to him for
such a man, and that Gage had transmitted the appeal
to Hallowell. Hallowell thought he knew Harlan,
and he was convinced that if he told Harlan flatly that
Morgan wanted to employ him for that definite purpose,
Harlan would refuse.
</p>
<p>And so Hallowell had gone about his work
obliquely. He knew Harlan more intimately than he
knew any other man in the country; and he was aware
that the chivalric impulse was stronger in Harlan than
in any man he knew.
</p>
<p>And he was aware, too, that Harlan was scrupulously
honest and square, despite the evil structure
which had been built around him by rumor. He had
watched Harlan for years, and knew him for exactly
what he was&mdash;an imaginative, reckless, impulsive
spirit who faced danger with the steady, unwavering
eye of complete unconcern.
</p>
<p>As Hallowell had talked of the Rancho Seco he had
seen Harlan&#8217;s eyes gleam; seen his lips curve with a
faint smile in which there was a hint of waywardness.
And so Hallowell knew he had scattered his words on
fertile mental soil.
</p>
<p>And yet Harlan would not have taken the trail that
led to the Rancho Seco had not the killing of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
friend, Davey Langan, followed closely upon the story
related to him by the marshal.
</p>
<p>Harlan had ridden eastward, to Lazette&mdash;a matter
of two hundred miles&mdash;trailing a herd of cattle from
the T Down&mdash;the ranch where he and Langan were
employed.
</p>
<p>When he returned he heard the story of the killing
of his friend by Dolver and another man, not identified,
but who rode a horse branded with the L Bar M&mdash;which
was the Rancho Seco brand.
</p>
<p>It was Hallowell who broke the news of the murder
to Harlan, together with the story of his pursuit of
Dolver and the other man, and of his failure to capture
them.
</p>
<p>There was no thought of romance in Harlan&#8217;s mind
when he mounted Purgatory to take up Dolver&#8217;s trail;
and when he came upon Dolver at Sentinel Rock&mdash;and
later, until he had talked with Lane Morgan&mdash;he
had no thought of offering himself to Morgan, to
become that trustworthy man who would &#8220;work his
guns&#8221; for the Rancho Seco owner.
</p>
<p>But after he had questioned Laskar&mdash;and had felt
that Laskar was not the accomplice of Dolver in the
murder of Langan&mdash;he had determined to go to the
ranch, and had told Morgan of his determination.
</p>
<p>Now, sitting on the threshold of the Rancho Seco
bunkhouse, he realized that his talk with Morgan
had brought him here in a different rôle than he had
anticipated.
</p>
<p>From where he sat he had a good view of all the
buildings&mdash;low, flat-roofed adobe structures, scattered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
on the big level with no regard for system, apparently&mdash;erected
as the needs of a growing ranch required.
Yet all were well kept and substantial, indicating that
Lane Morgan had been a man who believed in neatness
and permanency.
</p>
<p>The ranchhouse was the largest of the buildings.
It was two stories high on the side fronting the slope
that led to the river, and another section&mdash;in what
appeared to be the rear, facing the bunkhouse, also
had a second story&mdash;a narrow, boxlike, frowning section
which had the appearance of a blockhouse on the
parapet wall of a fort.
</p>
<p>And that, Harlan divined, was just what it had been
built for&mdash;for defensive purposes. For the entire
structure bore the appearance of age, and the style
of its architecture was an imitation of the Spanish
type. It was evident that Lane Morgan had considered
the warlike instincts of wandering bands of
Apache Indians when he had built his house.
</p>
<p>The walls connecting the fortlike section in the rear
with the two-story front were about ten feet in height,
with few windows; and the entire structure was built
in a huge square, with an inner court, or <i>patio</i>,
reached by an entrance that penetrated the lower
center of the two-story section in front.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s interest centered heavily upon the ranchhouse,
for it was there that Barbara Morgan had hidden
herself, fearing him.
</p>
<p>She had entered a door that opened in the wall
directly beneath the fortlike second story, and it was
upon this door that Harlan&#8217;s gaze was fixed. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
smiled wryly, for sight of the door brought Barbara
into his thoughts&mdash;though he was not sure she had
been out of them since the first instant of his meeting
with her in Lamo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been tellin&#8217; her them damn stories about
me bein&#8217; a hell-raiser&mdash;an&#8217; she believes &#8217;em,&#8221; he
mused. And then his smile faded. &#8220;An she ain&#8217;t
none reassured by my mug.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But it was upon the incident of his meeting with
Barbara, and the odd coincidence of his coming upon
her father at Sentinel Rock, that his thoughts dwelt
longest.
</p>
<p>It was odd&mdash;that meeting at Sentinel Rock. And
yet not so odd, either, considering everything.
</p>
<p>For he had been coming to the Rancho Seco.
Before he had reached Sentinel Rock he had been
determined to begin his campaign against the outlaws
at the Rancho Seco. It was his plan to ask Morgan
for a job, and to spend as much of his time as possible
in getting information about Deveny and his
men, in the hope of learning the identity of the man
who had assisted in the murder of Langan.
</p>
<p>What was odd about the incident was that Morgan
should attempt to cross to Pardo to have his gold
assayed at just about the time Harlan had decided to
begin his trip to the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>Harlan smiled as his gaze rested on the ranchhouse.
He was glad he had met Lane Morgan; he was glad
he had headed straight for Lamo after leaving Morgan.
For by going straight to Lamo he had been
able to balk Deveny&#8217;s evil intentions toward the girl
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
who, in the house now, was so terribly afraid of him.
</p>
<p>He had told Morgan why he was headed toward
the Rancho Seco section, but he had communicated to
Morgan that information only because he had wanted
to cheer the man in his last moments. That was what
had made Morgan&#8217;s face light up as his life had ebbed
away. And Harlan&#8217;s eyes glowed now with the recollection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The damned cuss&mdash;how he did brighten up!&#8221; he
mused. &#8220;He sure was a heap tickled to know that
the deck wasn&#8217;t all filled with dirty deuces.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And then Harlan&#8217;s thoughts went again to Lamo,
and to the picture Barbara had made running toward
him. It seemed to him that he could still feel her in
his arms, and a great regret that she distrusted him
assailed him.
</p>
<p>He had sat for a long time on the threshold of
the bunkhouse door, and after a time he noted that the
moon was swimming high, almost overhead. He got
up, unhurriedly, and again walked to the stable door,
looking in at Purgatory. For Harlan did not intend
to sleep tonight; he had resolved, since the Rancho
Seco seemed to be deserted except for his and Barbara&#8217;s
presence, to guard the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>For he knew that the passions of Deveny for the
girl were thoroughly aroused. He had seen in Deveny&#8217;s
eyes there in Lamo a flame&mdash;when Deveny
looked at Barbara&mdash;that told him more about the
man&#8217;s passions than Deveny himself suspected. He
grinned coldly as he leaned easily against the stable
door; for men of the Deveny type always aroused
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
him&mdash;their personality had always seemed to strike
discord into his soul; had always fanned into flame the
smoldering hatred he had of such men; had always
brought into his heart those savage impulses which
he had sometimes felt when he was on the verge of
yielding to the urge to become what men had thought
him&mdash;and what they still thought him&mdash;a conscienceless
killer.
</p>
<p>His smile now was bitter with the hatred that was
in his heart for Deveny&mdash;for Deveny had cast longing,
lustful eyes upon Barbara Morgan&mdash;and the
smile grew into a sneer as he drew out paper and
tobacco and began to roll a cigarette.
</p>
<p>But as he rolled the cigarette his fingers stiffened;
the paper and the tobacco in it dropped into the dust
at his feet; and he stiffened, his lips straightening, his
eyes flaming with rage, his muscles tensing.
</p>
<p>For a horseman had appeared from out of the
moonlit haze beyond the river. Rigid in the doorway&mdash;standing
back a little so that he might not be seen&mdash;Harlan
watched the man.
</p>
<p>The latter brought his horse to a halt when he
reached the far corner of the ranchhouse, dismounted,
and stole stealthily along the wall of the building.
</p>
<p>Harlan was not more than a hundred feet distant,
and the glare of the moonlight shining full on the man
as he paused before the door into which Barbara Morgan
had gone, revealed him plainly to Harlan.
</p>
<p>The man was Meeder Lawson. Harlan&#8217;s lips
wreathed into a grin of cold contempt. He stepped
quickly to Purgatory, drew his rifle from its saddle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
sheath and returned to the doorway. And there, standing
in the shadows, he watched Lawson as the latter
tried the door and, failing to open it, left it and crept
along the wall of the building, going toward a window.
</p>
<p>The window also was fastened, it seemed, for Lawson
stole away from it after a time and continued along
the wall of the house until he reached the southeast
corner. Around that, after a fleeting glance about
him, Lawson vanished.
</p>
<p>Still grinning&mdash;though there was now a quality in
the grin that might have warned Lawson, had he seen
it&mdash;Harlan stepped down from the doorway, slipped
into the shadow of the corral fence, and made his way
toward the corner where Lawson had disappeared.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE INTRUDER</h3>
</div>

<p>After closing the door through which she had
entered, Barbara Morgan slipped the fastenings
into place and stood, an ear pressed against the door,
listening for sounds that would tell her Harlan had
followed her. But beyond the door all was silence.
</p>
<p>Breathing fast, yielding to the panic of fear that had
seized her, over the odd light she had seen in Harlan&#8217;s
eyes&mdash;a gleam, that to her, seemed to have been a
reflection of some evil passion in the man&#8217;s heart&mdash;she
ran through the dark room she had entered,
opened a door that led to the <i>patio</i>, and peered fearfully
outward, as though she half expected to see Harlan
there.
</p>
<p>But the court was deserted, apparently, though there
were somber shadows ranging the enclosing walls that
would afford concealment for Harlan, had he succeeded
in gaining entrance. As she stepped out of the
doorway she peered intently around.
</p>
<p>Then, further frightened by the brooding silence
that seemed to envelop the place, and tortured by
tragic thoughts in which her father occupied a prominent
position&mdash;almost crazed by the memory of what
had happened during the preceding twenty-four hours&mdash;she
fled across the <i>patio</i> swiftly, her terror growing
with each step.
</p>
<p>She knew the house thoroughly; she could have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
found her way in complete darkness; and when she
reached the opposite side of the court she almost threw
herself at a door which, she knew, opened into the
big room in which she and her father had usually
passed their leisure.
</p>
<p>Entering, she closed the door, and barred it. Then,
feeling more secure, she stood for an instant in the
center of the room, gazing about, afflicted with an
appalling sense of loss, of loneliness, and of helplessness.
</p>
<p>For this was the first time she had entered the
house since the news of her father&#8217;s death had reached
her; and she missed him, feeling more keenly than
ever the grief she had endured thus far with a certain
stoic calm; yielding to the tears that had been very
close for hours.
</p>
<p>She did not light the kerosene lamp that stood on a
big center table in the room. For there was light
enough for her to see objects around her; and she
went at last to an arm-chair which had been her
father&#8217;s favorite, knelt beside it, and sobbed convulsively.
</p>
<p>Later, yielding to a dull apathy which had stolen
over her, she made her way upstairs, to her room&mdash;which
was directly over the front entrance to the <i>patio</i>&mdash;and
sank into a chair beside one of the windows.
</p>
<p>She had locked her door after entering; and for
the first time since arriving at the Rancho Seco she
felt comparatively safe.
</p>
<p>Her thoughts were incoherent&mdash;a queer jumble of
mental impulses which seemed to lead her always back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
to the harrowing realization that she had lost her
father. That was the gigantic axis around which her
whole mental structure revolved. It was staggering,
stupefying, and her brain reeled under it.
</p>
<p>Other thoughts came, flickered like feeble lights,
and went out&mdash;thoughts of what had happened to her
at Lamo; a dull wonder over Meeder Lawson&#8217;s presence
in town when he should have been with the men
on the range; speculation as to the whereabouts of the
men&mdash;why none of them had remained at the ranchhouse;
and a sort of dumb, vague wonder over what
her future would be.
</p>
<p>She thought, too, of John Haydon of the Star ranch&mdash;the
big, smiling, serene-eyed man who seemed to
bring a breath of romance with him each time he
visited the Rancho Seco. Haydon would help her, she
knew, and she would go to him in the morning.
</p>
<p>Her father had trusted Haydon, and she would
trust him. Haydon was the one man in the section
who seemed to have no fear of Deveny and his men&mdash;many
times he had told her that most of the stories
told of Deveny&#8217;s crimes were untrue&mdash;that he had not
committed all those that were attributed to him.
</p>
<p>Not that Haydon condoned those offenses upon
which Deveny stood convicted by circumstantial evidence.
Nor had Haydon ever sought to defend Deveny.
On the other hand, Haydon&#8217;s condemnation of
the outlaw and his men had been vigorous&mdash;almost
too vigorous for Haydon&#8217;s safety, she had heard her
father say.
</p>
<p>It was when her thoughts dwelt upon Harlan that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
she was most puzzled&mdash;and impressed. For though
she was acquainted with the man&#8217;s reputation&mdash;knowing
him to be an outlaw of the reckless, dare-devil type&mdash;she
felt the force of him, the compelling originality
of him&mdash;as he differed from the outlaw of popular
conception&mdash;his odd personality, which seemed to be
a mingling of the elements of character embracing both
good and evil.
</p>
<p>For though an outlaw himself, he had protected
her from outlaws. And she had seen in his eyes certain
expressions that told her that he felt impulses of
sympathy and of tenderness. And his words to Deveny
and others had seemed to hint of a fairly high honorableness.
</p>
<p>And though she had seen in his eyes a cold gleam
that was convincing evidence of the presence of those
ruthless passions which had made him an enemy of
the law, she had also detected expressions in his eyes
that told plainly of genial humor, of gentleness, and
of consideration for other humans.
</p>
<p>But whatever she had seen in him, she felt his force&mdash;the
terrible power of him when aroused. It was
in the atmosphere that surrounded him; it was in the
steady gleam of his eyes, in the poise of his head, and
in the thrust of his jaw, all around him. She feared
him, yet he fascinated her&mdash;compelled her&mdash;seemed
to insist that she consider him in her scheme of life.
</p>
<p>In fact, he had made it plain to her that he intended
to be considered. &#8220;I&#8217;m stayin&#8217; here,&#8221; he had told her
in his slow, deliberate way.
</p>
<p>And that seemed to end it&mdash;she knew he <i>would</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
stay; that he was determined, and that nothing short
of force would dissuade him. And what force could
she bring against him? A man whose name, mentioned
in the presence of other men, made their faces blanch.
</p>
<p>Deep in her heart, though, lurked a conviction that
Harlan had not told her everything that had happened
at Sentinel Rock. She was afflicted with a suspicion
that he was holding something back. She had
seen that in his eyes, too, she thought. It seemed to
her that her father <i>might</i> have told him to come to
the Rancho Seco, and to stay there. And for that
reason&mdash;because she suspected that Harlan had not
told all he knew&mdash;she felt that she ought not order
him away. If only he had not looked at her with
that queer, insinuating smile!
</p>
<p>She had sat at the window for, it seemed to her,
many hours before she became aware that the moon
had risen and was directly overhead, flooding the
ground in the vicinity of the ranchhouse with a soft,
silver radiance.
</p>
<p>She got up with a start, remembering that she had
left Harlan standing outside the door in the rear. She
had almost forgotten that!
</p>
<p>She went to a window that opened into the <i>patio</i>,
and looked downward. Every nook and corner of the
<i>patio</i> was visible now; the dark, somber shadows had
been driven away, and in the silvery flood that poured
down from above the enclosure was brilliant, clearly
defined&mdash;and deserted.
</p>
<p>And yet as the girl looked, a presentiment of evil
assailed her, whitening her cheeks and widening her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
eyes. The quiet peace and tranquillity of the <i>patio</i>
seemed to mock her; she felt that it held a sinister
promise, a threat of dire things to come.
</p>
<p>The feeling was so strong that it drove her back
from the window to the center of the room, where she
stood, holding her breath, her hands clasped in front
of her, the fingers twining stiffly. It seemed to her that
she was waiting&mdash;waiting for something to happen&mdash;something
that threatened.
</p>
<p>And when she heard a slight sound, seeming to arise
from the room below her, she caught her breath with
a gasp of horror.
</p>
<p>But she did not move. She stood there, with no
breath issuing from between her lips, for many minutes,
it seemed&mdash;waiting, dreading, a cold paralysis
stealing over her.
</p>
<p>And then again it came&mdash;an odd sound&mdash;slow,
creaking, seeming to come always nearer. It was not
until she heard the sound directly outside her door
that she realized that what she heard was a step on
the stairs. And then, convinced that Harlan had
gained entrance, she slipped noiselessly across the room
to the front wall, where she took down a heavy pistol
that hung from a wooden peg.
</p>
<p>With the huge weapon in hand she returned to a
point near the center of the room, and with bated
breath and glowing, determined eyes, faced the door.
</p>
<p>And when, after a time, she heard the door creak
with a weight that seemed to be against it&mdash;after she
saw it give; heard the lock break, and saw a man&#8217;s
form darken the opening as the door was flung wide&mdash;she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
pressed the trigger of the weapon once&mdash;twice&mdash;three
times&mdash;in rapid succession.
</p>
<p>She heard the man curse, saw him catch at his chest,
and tumble headlong toward her. And she fired
again, thinking he was trying to grasp her.
</p>
<p>She laughed hysterically when she saw him sink to
the floor and stretch out with a queer inertness. Then,
swaying, her brain reeling with the horror of the thing,
she managed to get to the bed at the other side of the
room. When she reached it she collapsed gently, a
long, convulsive shudder running over her.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>BARBARA SEES A LIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>When Barbara regained consciousness it was
with a gasp of horror over the realization of
what had happened. She stiffened immediately, however,
and lay, straining at the dread paralysis that had
gripped her; for she saw Harlan standing at her side,
looking down into her face, his own set in a grim smile.
</p>
<p>She must have fainted again, for it seemed to her
that a long period of time elapsed until she again became
conscious of her surroundings. Harlan had
moved off a little, though he was still watching her
with the grimly humorous expression.
</p>
<p>She sat up, staring wildly at him; then shrank back,
getting as far away from him as she could.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;You! Didn&#8217;t I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He interrupted her, drawling his words a little:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The guy you shot was Lawson. You bored him a
heap. I&#8217;ve toted him downstairs. He&#8217;s plenty dead.
It was plumb good shootin&#8217;&mdash;for a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His words shocked her to action, and she got up
and walked around the foot of the bed, from where
she could see the spot where the intruder must have
fallen after she had shot him. A dark stain showed
on the floor where the man had lain, and the sight of
it sent her a step backward, so that she struck the foot
of the bed. She caught at the bed and grasped one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
of the posts, holding tightly to it while she looked
Harlan over with dreading, incredulous eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t <i>you</i>!&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;Are you
sure?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He smiled and said, slowly and consolingly: &#8220;I
reckon if you&#8217;d shot <i>me</i> I&#8217;d be knowin&#8217; it. Don&#8217;t take
it so hard, ma&#8217;am. Why, if a man goes to breakin&#8217;
into a woman&#8217;s room that way he sure ain&#8217;t fit to go
on livin&#8217; in a world where there <i>is</i> a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Lawson&mdash;you say? Meeder Lawson&mdash;the
Rancho Seco foreman? I thought&mdash;why, I
thought it was you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankin&#8217; you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, ironically.
&#8220;But if you&#8217;ll just stick your head out of that window,
you&#8217;ll see it was Lawson, right enough. He&#8217;s layin&#8217;
right below the window.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did as bidden, and she saw Lawson lying on the
ground beneath the window, flat on his back, his face
turned upward with the radiant moonlight shining full
upon his wide-open, staring eyes.
</p>
<p>Barbara glanced swiftly, and then drew back into
the room, shuddering.
</p>
<p>Harlan stood, silently regarding her, while she
walked again to the bed and sat upon it, staring out
into the flood of moonlight, her face ghastly, her
hands hanging limply at her sides.
</p>
<p>She had killed a man. And though there was justification
for the deed, she could not fight down the
shivering horror that had seized her, the overpowering
and terrible knowledge that she had taken human life.
</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed for a long time, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
Harlan said no word to her, standing motionless, his
arms folded, one hand slowly caressing his chin, as he
watched her.
</p>
<p>After a time, drawing a long, shuddering breath,
she looked up at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know&mdash;what made you come&mdash;here?&#8221;
she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t reckonin&#8217; to sleep tonight&mdash;havin&#8217;
thoughts&mdash;about things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was puttin&#8217;
in a heap of my time settin&#8217; in the doorway of the
bunkhouse, wonderin&#8217; what had made you so scared
of me. While I was tryin&#8217; to figure it out I saw Lawson
comin&#8217;. There was somethin&#8217; in his actions which
didn&#8217;t jibe with my ideas of square dealin&#8217;, an&#8217; so I
kept lookin&#8217; at him. An&#8217; when I saw him prowlin&#8217;
around, tryin&#8217; to open doors an&#8217; windows, why, I just
naturally trailed him. An&#8217; I found the window he
opened. I reckon that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She got up, swaying a little, a wan smile on her
face that reflected her astonishment and wonder over
the way she had jumbled things. For this man&mdash;the
man she had feared when she had left him standing
outside the door some hours before&mdash;had been eager
to protect her from the other, who had attacked her.
He had been waiting, watching.
</p>
<p>Moreover, there was in Harlan&#8217;s eyes as he stood
in the room a considerate, deferential gleam that told
her more than words could have conveyed to her&mdash;a
something that convinced her that he was not the type
of man she had thought him.
</p>
<p>The knowledge filled her with a strange delight.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
There was relief in her eyes, and her voice was almost
steady when she again spoke to him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan,&#8221; she said, &#8220;did father really send you
here? Did he make you promise to come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon he did, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>For an instant she looked fairly at him, intently
searching his eyes for indications of untruthfulness.
Then she drew a long breath of conviction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>Harlan swept his hat from his head. He bowed,
and there was an odd leap in his voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;That tickles me a heap, ma&#8217;am. I don&#8217;t know
when I&#8217;ve heard anything that pleased me more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He backed away from her until he reached the doorway.
And she saw his eyes&mdash;wide and eloquent&mdash;even
in the subdued light of the doorway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d go to sleep now, ma&#8217;am, if I was you. You
need it a heap. It&#8217;s been a long day for you&mdash;an&#8217;
things ain&#8217;t gone just right. I don&#8217;t reckon there&#8217;ll be
anybody botherin&#8217; you any more tonight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; she asked, &#8220;won&#8217;t you try to get some
sleep, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He laughed, telling her that he would &#8220;ketch a
wink or two.&#8221; Then he turned and went down the
stairs&mdash;she could hear him as he opened a lower
door and went out.
</p>
<p>Looking out of the window an instant later, she
saw him taking Lawson&#8217;s body away. And still later,
hearing a sound outside, she stole to the window again.
</p>
<p>Below, seated on the threshold of the door that led
into the room she had entered when she had crossed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
the <i>patio</i>, she saw Harlan. He was smoking a cigarette,
leaning against the door jamb in an attitude of
complete relaxation.
</p>
<p>There was something in his manner that comforted
her&mdash;a calm confidence, a slow ease of movement as
he fingered his cigarette that indicated perfect tranquility&mdash;an
atmosphere of peace that could not have
surrounded him had he meditated any evil whatever.
</p>
<p>She knew, now, that she had misjudged him. For
he had made no attempt to take advantage of her loneliness
and helplessness. And whatever his reputation&mdash;whatever
the crimes he had committed against the
laws&mdash;he had been a gentleman in his attitude toward
her. That feature of his conduct dominated her
thoughts as she stretched out on the bed; it was her
last coherent thought as she went to sleep.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>HARLAN TAKES CHARGE</h3>
</div>

<p>Barbara could not have told why she had not
acted upon her determination to ride westward
to the Star ranch to acquaint John Haydon with the
predicament into which the events of the past few
hours had plunged her. She could not have explained
why she permitted the first day&mdash;after Harlan&#8217;s coming&mdash;to
pass without going to see Haydon, any more
than she could have explained why she permitted many
other days to pass in the same manner.
</p>
<p>She was almost convinced, though, that it was because
of the manner in which Harlan took charge of
the ranch&mdash;the capable and business-like way he had
of treating the men.
</p>
<p>For the outfit came in late in the afternoon following
the night which had marked the death of Lawson&mdash;the
straw-boss explaining that he had received explicit
orders from Lawson to &#8220;work&#8221; a grass level
several miles down the river.
</p>
<p>One other reason for Barbara&#8217;s failure to ride to the
Star&mdash;a reason that she did not permit to dwell prominently
in her thoughts&mdash;was resentment.
</p>
<p>She had permitted the first day to pass without
going to see Haydon. But when it had gone and
another day dawned without Haydon coming to see
<i>her</i>, she felt that he was deliberately absenting himself.
For certainly he must have heard what had happened,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
and if he thought as much of her as he had led her to
believe he would have come to her instantly.
</p>
<p>Had Haydon seen the defiant gleam of her eyes
when she gazed westward&mdash;in the direction of the
Star&mdash;he might have realized that each day he stayed
away from the Rancho Seco would make it that much
more difficult for him to explain.
</p>
<p>Barbara stayed indoors much of the time during
the first days of Harlan&#8217;s control of the ranch, but
from the windows she saw him&mdash;noted that the men
obeyed him promptly and without question.
</p>
<p>A sense of loss, of emptiness, still afflicted the girl,
and yet through it all there ran a thrill of satisfaction,
of assurance that the steady-eyed man who had saved
her from Deveny, and who had treated her like a
courtier of old on the night she had killed Lawson,
seemed to have her welfare in mind, seemed&mdash;despite
the reputation the people of the country had given
him&mdash;to have constituted himself her guardian, without
expectation of reward of the kind she had feared
he sought.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s method of assuming control of the Rancho
Seco had been direct and simple. When the twenty-seven
men of the outfit had straggled into the yard
surrounding the big corral&mdash;the chuck-wagon, bearing
the cook and his assistant, trailing a little behind, and
followed by the horses of the <i>remuda</i> with the wrangler
hurling vitriolic language in the rear&mdash;Harlan
was standing beside Purgatory near the corral fence in
front of one of the bunkhouses.
</p>
<p>He had paid&mdash;apparently&mdash;no attention to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
men as they dismounted, unsaddled, and turned their
horses into the corral, and he did not even look at the
belligerent-eyed cook whose sardonic glance roved over
him.
</p>
<p>But the men of the outfit watched him out of the
corners of their eyes; as they passed him to go to the
bunkhouses, they shot inquiring, speculating glances at
one another, full of curiosity, not unmixed with astonishment
over his continued silence.
</p>
<p>It was when, drawn by the wonder that consumed
them, they gathered in a group near the door of one
of the bunkhouses, that Harlan moved toward them.
</p>
<p>For he had noted that they had become grouped,
and that into the atmosphere had come a tension.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s actions had been governed by design. His
continued silence had been strategy of a subtle order.
It had attracted the attention of the men, it had intrigued
their interest.
</p>
<p>If he had spoken to them while they had been moving
about on their different errands, telling them that
henceforth he was to manage the Rancho Seco, they
would have given him scant attention. Also, he would
not have been able to study their faces as he had
studied them while they had been watching him, and
he would not have gained the knowledge of their characters
that he now possessed.
</p>
<p>Besides, a humorous malice possessed Harlan&mdash;he
wanted to view them collectively when he gave them
his news, to note the various ways in which they would
receive it.
</p>
<p>Absolute silence greeted Harlan&#8217;s forward movement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
He could hear the labored breathing of some
of the men&mdash;men of violent temper who sensed
trouble&mdash;and his grin grew broad as he halted within
a dozen feet of the group.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got a new boss.
It&#8217;s me. A day or so ago, crossin&#8217; from Pardo, I run
into a ruckus at Sentinel Rock. Lane Morgan was the
center of the ruckus&mdash;an&#8217; he got perforated&mdash;plenty.
But before he cashed in he got a gleam of downright
sense an&#8217; told me he&#8217;d been lookin&#8217; for me, to make
me manager of the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m reckonin&#8217; to be manager&mdash;beginnin&#8217; now. If
there&#8217;s any of you men that ain&#8217;t admirin&#8217; to do the
jumpin&#8217; when I yap orders to you, you&#8217;re doin&#8217; your
gassin&#8217; right now. Them that&#8217;s pinin&#8217; to work under
me is sure of a square deal, beginnin&#8217; now, and continuin&#8217;
henceforth. I reckon that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Into Harlan&#8217;s eyes as he talked had come that vacuous
light that had been in them when he had faced
Deveny&#8217;s men in Lamo&mdash;the light that was always in
his eyes whenever he faced more than one man, with
trouble imminent.
</p>
<p>He saw the face of every man in the group&mdash;while
seeming not to be looking at any of them. He noted
the various shades of expression that came into their
faces as they digested his words, he saw how some of
them watched him with sober interest and how others
permitted themselves a sneer of incredulity or dislike.
</p>
<p>He noted that a tall, slender, swarthy man on the
extreme left of the group watched him with a malevolent
gaze, his eyes flaming hate; he saw a black-haired,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
hook-nosed fellow near the center of the group
watching him with a grin of cold contempt.
</p>
<p>It seemed to Harlan that a fair proportion of the
men were willing to acknowledge his authority&mdash;for
they were frankly studying him, ready to greet him as
their employer. Many others, however, were as
frankly hostile.
</p>
<p>After Harlan ceased speaking there came a short
silence, during which many of the men looked at one
another inquiringly.
</p>
<p>It was a moment during which, had a leader appeared
to take the initiative for those who intended
to dissent from Harlan&#8217;s rule, the outfit might have
been divided.
</p>
<p>Evidently the tall, swarthy man divined that the
time to dissent had come, for he cleared his throat, and
grinned felinely.
</p>
<p>Before he could speak, however, a short man with
keen eyes that, since the instant they had rested upon
Harlan, had been glowing with something that might
have been defined as mingled astonishment and delight
thinly concealed by a veneer of humor&mdash;said distinctly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You crossed over from Pardo&mdash;you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan nodded, and a pin-point of recognition
glowed in his eyes as he looked at the man.
</p>
<p>The other laughed, lowly. &#8220;Seems I know you,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re &#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A tremor ran through the group. There was a concerted
stiffening of bodies, a general sigh from lungs
in process of deflation. And then the group stood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
silent, every man watching Harlan with that intent
curiosity that comes with one&#8217;s first glimpse of a noted
character, introduced without expectation.
</p>
<p>Harlan noted that a change had come over the men.
Those whose faces had betrayed their inclination to accept
his authority had taken&mdash;without exception&mdash;a
glum, disappointed expression. On the other hand,
those who had formerly betrayed hostility, were now
grinning with satisfaction.
</p>
<p>A tremor of malicious amusement, expressed visibly
by a flicker of his eyelids, was Harlan&#8217;s only emotion
over the change that had come in the men of the
group. He could now have selected those of the men
who&mdash;as Lane Morgan had said&mdash;could not be
trusted, and he could have pointed out those who had
been loyal to Morgan, and who would be loyal to
Barbara and himself.
</p>
<p>Among the former were the tall, swarthy man on
the extreme left, and the hook-nosed fellow near the
center. There were perhaps ten of the latter, and it
was plain to Harlan that the short man who had
spoken was their leader.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was the tall, swarthy man. The malevolence
had gone from his eyes, he was grinning broadly,
though there was respect of a fawning character in his
manner as he stepped out from the group and halted
within a few feet of Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; my friends wasn&#8217;t none tickled to find that
we was goin&#8217; to have a new manager. We was sort of
expectin&#8217; Miss Barbara to do the runnin&#8217; herself. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
if <i>you</i> say you&#8217;re runnin&#8217; things, that makes it a whole
lot different. We ain&#8217;t buckin&#8217; &#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan&#8217;s
game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; grinned Harlan. &#8220;I saw you reportin&#8217;
to Miss Morgan. You&#8217;re straw-boss, I reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it. I&#8217;m Stroud&mdash;Lafe Stroud.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll keep on bein&#8217; straw-boss,&#8221; said Harlan,
shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m appointin&#8217; a foreman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Lawson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Stroud who spoke. There was a shadow of
disappointment in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawson won&#8217;t be needin&#8217; a title any more,&#8221; said
Harlan, narrowing his eyes at the other. &#8220;He needs
plantin&#8217;. Soon as we get set some of you boys can go
over an&#8217; take care of him. You&#8217;ll find him in the
harness shop. He busted down the door of Miss Barbara&#8217;s
room last night, an&#8217; she made a colander out
of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan ignored the effect of his news on the men,
fixing his gaze on the short man who had spoken first,
and who was now standing silent, in an attitude that
hinted of dejection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be foreman, Linton,&#8221; he stated shortly.
</p>
<p>Linton, who had been glumly listening, was so
startled by the sudden descent upon his shoulders of
the mantle of authority that he straightened with a
snap and grabbed wildly at his hat&mdash;which dropped
from his head despite his effort to clutch it, revealing
a mop of fiery red hair. When he straightened, after
recovering the hat, his freckled face was crimson with
embarrassment and astonishment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you,&#8221; he mumbled.
</p>
<p>That had ended it. The following morning Linton
came to Harlan for orders, and a little later the entire
outfit, headed by Stroud, and trailed by the chuck-wagon
and the horses of the <i>remuda</i>, started southward
to a distant section of the big level, leaving Linton
and Harlan at the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>And as the outfit faded into the southern distance,
Harlan, walking near the larger of the two bunkhouses,
came upon Linton.
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned when he saw the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t go with the outfit, Red?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Seems a foreman ought to be mighty eager to be with
his men on their first trip after he&#8217;s appointed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Linton&#8217;s face was pale, his gaze was direct.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Harlan,&#8221; he said, steadily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
knowed you a long time, an&#8217; I know that you&#8217;re a
damn&#8217; sight straighter than a lot of men which has got
reputations better than yourn. But there&#8217;s some things
want explainin&#8217;. I&#8217;ve sort of took a shine to that little
girl in there. There&#8217;s things brewin&#8217; which is goin&#8217;
to make it mighty bad for her. It wasn&#8217;t so bad while
old Morgan was here, but now he&#8217;s gone, an&#8217; she&#8217;s got
to play it a lone hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You git riled an&#8217; sling your gun on me if you want
to. I know I wouldn&#8217;t have a chance. But just the
same, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you. You know that more&#8217;n half that
outfit you&#8217;ve put me at the head of is Deveny&#8217;s men&mdash;sneakin&#8217;,
thievin&#8217;, murderin&#8217; outlaws?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wantin&#8217; to quit, Red?&#8221; said Harlan, smoothly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit! Hell&#8217;s fire! I&#8217;m hangin&#8217; on to the finish.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
But I&#8217;m findin&#8217; out where you stand. What you
meanin&#8217; to do with Barbara Morgan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned. &#8220;I answered that question when I
appointed you foreman, Red. But I reckon I made a
mistake&mdash;I ought to have appointed a man who knows
what his think-box is for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Linton flushed, and peered intently at the other.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; that you&#8217;re backin&#8217; Barbara in this here
deal?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A real thoughtful man would have tumbled to it
quicker,&#8221; was Harlan&#8217;s soft, ironical reply.
</p>
<p>For an instant Linton&#8217;s gaze was intense with
searching, probing inquiry. And Harlan&#8217;s steady eyes
were agleam with a light that was so quietly honest
that it made Linton gasp:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn me! You mean it! You&#8217;re playin&#8217; &#8217;em
straight, face up. That talk of yourn about Lane
Morgan makin&#8217; you manager was straight goods. I
know Dolver an&#8217; Laskar an&#8217; the guy they call &#8216;Chief&#8217;
plugged Morgan&mdash;for I heard Stroud an&#8217; some more
of them talkin&#8217; about it. An&#8217; I heard that you got
Dolver an&#8217; Laskar, an&#8217; kept Deveny from grabbin&#8217; off
Barbara Morgan, over in Lamo. But I thought you
was playin&#8217; for Barbara, too&mdash;an&#8217; I wasn&#8217;t figurin&#8217; on
lettin&#8217; you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan laughed lowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Things don&#8217;t always shape up the way a man
thinks they will, Red. I started for Lamo, figurin&#8217; to
salivate Dolver an&#8217; the other guy who killed Davey
Langan. I got Dolver at Sentinel Rock, an&#8217; I figured
I&#8217;d be likely to run into the other guy somewheres&mdash;mebbe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
findin&#8217; him in Deveny&#8217;s gang. But runnin&#8217; into
Lane Morgan sort of changed the deal. An&#8217; now I&#8217;m
postponin&#8217; a lot of things until Barbara Morgan is
runnin&#8217; free, with no coyotes from the Deveny crowd
tryin&#8217; to rope her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Linton&#8217;s eyes were glowing, he crowded close to
Harlan, so close that his body touched Harlan&#8217;s,
and he stood thus for an instant, breathing fast. Then,
noting the unwavering, genial gleam in Harlan&#8217;s eyes&mdash;a
visible sign of Harlan&#8217;s knowledge of his deep
emotion&mdash;Linton seized one of the other&#8217;s hands and
gripped it tightly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn your hide,&#8221; he said, lowly, &#8220;you had me
goin&#8217;. I&#8217;m dead set on seein&#8217; that girl git a square
deal, an&#8217; when I saw you makin&#8217; a play for them
damned outlaws that are in the outfit, I sure figured
there&#8217;d be hell a-poppin&#8217; around the Rancho Seco.
You sure had me flabbergasted when you named me
foreman, for I couldn&#8217;t anticipate your trail none.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I reckon I&#8217;m wised up, now. You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
run a whizzer in on &#8217;em&mdash;playin&#8217; &#8217;em for suckers.
An&#8217; I&#8217;m your right-hand man&mdash;stickin&#8217; with you until
hell runs long on icebergs!&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>SHADOWS</h3>
</div>

<p>A desire to ride once more in the peaceful sunshine
of the land she loved was one of the first
indications that Barbara was recovering from the shock
occasioned by her father&#8217;s death. For two or three
days she had not stirred from her room, except to go
downstairs to cook her meals. She had spent much of
her time sitting at a window nursing her sorrow.
</p>
<p>But on this morning she got out of bed feeling more
composed than usual, with several new emotions struggling
for the mastery. One of those emotions was
that of intolerance.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s assumption of authority enraged her. He
had come to the Rancho Seco with no credentials other
than his mere word that her father had forced him
to promise to &#8220;take hold&#8221; of &#8220;things.&#8221; And she intended,
this very morning, to send Harlan away, and
to assume control of the ranch herself.
</p>
<p>This determination held until after she had breakfasted,
and then she stood for a long time in the
kitchen door, looking out into the brilliant sunshine,
afflicted with a strange indecision.
</p>
<p>Harlan <i>had</i> helped to fill the void created by her
father&#8217;s death&mdash;that was certain. There had been
something satisfying in his presence at the ranch; it
had seemed to mean an assurance for her safety; she
had felt almost as fully protected as when her father
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
had been with her. It angered her to see him moving
about the place as though he had a perfect right to be
there, but at the same time she felt comfortably certain
that as long as he was around no harm could come
to her.
</p>
<p>Her emotions were so contradictory that she could
not reach a decision regarding the action she should
take and she bit her lips with vexation as she stood in
the doorway.
</p>
<p>Later, her cheeks a little flushed with the realization
that she was surrendering to an emotion that she could
not understand&mdash;but which, she decided guiltily, her
face crimson, had its inception in a conviction that she
would regret seeing Harlan ride away, to return no
more&mdash;she went to the corral, roped her pony, threw
saddle and bridle on it, mounted the animal, and rode
away&mdash;westward.
</p>
<p>She had not traveled more than half a mile when
she heard the rapid beating of hoofs behind her.
Glancing swiftly backward, she saw Purgatory coming,
Harlan in the saddle, smoking a cigarette.
</p>
<p>Her pulses leaped, unaccountably, and the crimson
flush again stained her cheeks; but she sat rigid in the
saddle, and looked straight ahead, pretending she had
not discovered the presence of horse and rider behind
her.
</p>
<p>She rode another half mile before the flush died out
of her cheeks. And then, responding to a swift indignation,
she brought Billy to a halt, wheeled him, and
sat motionless in the saddle, her face pale, her eyes
flashing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>With apparent unconcern Harlan rode toward her.
The big black horse did not change his pace, nor did
Harlan change expression. It seemed to the girl that
in both horse and rider were a steadfastness of purpose
that nothing could change. And despite her indignation,
she felt a thrill of admiration for both man and
horse.
</p>
<p>Yet her eyes were still flashing ominously when Harlan
rode to within a dozen paces of her and brought
the big black to a halt.
</p>
<p>There was an expression of grave respect on Harlan&#8217;s
face; but she saw a lurking devil in his eyes&mdash;a
gleam of steady, quizzical humor&mdash;that made her
yearn to use her quirt on him. For by that gleam she
knew he had purposely followed her; that he expected
her to be angry with him for doing so. And the gleam
also told her that he had determined to bear with her
anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she inquired, icily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good mornin&#8217;, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He bowed to her, sweeping
his broad-brimmed hat from his head with, it
seemed to her, an ironical flourish.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there something you want to speak to me
about?&#8221; she asked, her chin elevated, disdain in her
eyes. She assured herself that when he glanced at her
as he was doing at this instant, she positively hated
him. She wondered why she had tolerated his
presence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t havin&#8217; any thoughts about speakin&#8217; to you,
ma&#8217;am. Kind of a nice mornin&#8217; for a ride, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If one rides alone,&#8221; she returned, significantly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoy ridin&#8217; a whole lot better when I&#8217;ve got
company,&#8221; he stated, gravely, with equal significance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that you have made up your mind to ride
with me, I suppose?&#8221; she said coldly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she declared, her voice quivering with passion;
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to ride with me. You came
here and usurped whatever power and authority there
is; and you are running the Rancho Seco as though it
belongs to you. But you shan&#8217;t ride with me&mdash;I don&#8217;t
want you to!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Had she been standing she must have stamped one
foot on the ground, so vehement was her manner. And
the flashing scorn of her eyes should have been enough
to discourage most men.
</p>
<p>But not Harlan. His eyelids flickered with some
emotion; and his eyes&mdash;she noted now, even though
she could have killed him for his maddening insistence&mdash;were
blue, and rimmed by heavy lashes that sun
and sand had bleached until the natural brown of them
threatened to become a light tan.
</p>
<p>She studied him, even while hating him for she saw
the force of him&mdash;felt it. And though she was thinking
spiteful things of him, she found that she was
forming a new impression of him&mdash;of his character,
his appearance, and of the motives that controlled
him.
</p>
<p>And she thought she knew why men avoided having
trouble with him. She told herself that if she were a
man and she were facing him with violence in her
heart, she would consider seriously before she betrayed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
it to him. For in his eyes, in the lips, in the thrust of
his chin&mdash;even in the atmosphere that surrounded him
at this instant, was a threat, an unspoken promise, lingering
and dormant, of complete readiness&mdash;almost
eagerness, she was convinced&mdash;for violence.
</p>
<p>She drew a sharp breath as she watched him. And
when she saw his lips curving into a slight smile&mdash;wholesome,
though grave; with a hint of boyish amusement
in them&mdash;she got another quick impression of
his character, new and startling and illuminating.
</p>
<p>For behind the hard, unyielding exterior that he
presented to men; back of the promise and the threat
of violence, was the impulsiveness and the gentleness
that would have ruled him had not the stern necessity
of self-preservation forced him to conceal them.
</p>
<p>The smile disarmed her. It <i>did</i> seem ludicrous&mdash;that
she should try to force this man to do anything he
did not want to do. And she had known that he would
not obey her, and ride back to the ranchhouse; she
was convinced that she must either go back or suffer
him to follow her as he pleased.
</p>
<p>And she was determined not to give up her ride.
She was determined to be very haughty about it,
though; but when she wheeled Billy, to head him again
into the western distance, her eyes twinkled her surrender,
and her lips trembled on the verge of a defiant
smile.
</p>
<p>Then Billy felt the quirt on his flank; he snorted
with astonishment and disgust, and charged forward,
tossing his head intolerantly.
</p>
<p>Looking sidelong, after Billy had traveled two or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
three hundred yards, Barbara observed that the big
black horse was not more than half a dozen steps behind.
And curiously, Barbara again experienced that
comfortable assurance of protection, and of satisfaction
over the nearness of Harlan.
</p>
<p>Moved by an entirely unaccountable impulse, she
drew the reins slightly on Billy, slowing him, almost
imperceptibly, so that both horses had traveled more
than a quarter of a mile before the distance between
them lessened noticeably.
</p>
<p>And then, with an impatience that caused her cheeks
to glow, Barbara noted that Purgatory had slowed
also, Harlan seemingly accommodating the animal&#8217;s
pace to her own. It was plain to see that Harlan did
not intend to assume that she had relented.
</p>
<p>For another quarter of a mile the distance remained
the same, and the silence was unbroken except by the
rhythmical beating of hoofs through the rustling,
matted mesquite.
</p>
<p>Then Barbara, yielding to an impulse of righteous
anger, brought on by Harlan&#8217;s obvious intention to
remain at a respectful distance, deliberately brought
Billy to a walk and waited until Harlan rode beside
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be a brute&mdash;even if I did tell
you to go back to the ranchhouse!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; what, ma&#8217;am? Why, I don&#8217;t remember
to have done anything. I was doin&#8217; a heap of thinkin&#8217;
just now&mdash;if that&#8217;s what you mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking mean things of me&mdash;I suppose&mdash;for
what I said to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>He had been thinking of her&mdash;seriously. And his
thoughts were far from fickle as he watched her now,
riding within a few feet of him, her profile toward him,
her head having a rigid set, her chin held high, her
lips tight-pressed, and her hair drooping in graceful
coils over her ears, and bulging in alluring disorder at
the nape of her neck.
</p>
<p>He was thinking that he had braved, to answer a
mere whim, greater dangers than he would be likely
to meet in defending her from the wolf-pack which
circumstances had set upon her. He was thinking that
heretofore his life had been lived without regard to
order or system&mdash;that he had led a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp
existence, never knowing that such women as she
graced the world. He was thinking of what might
have happened to her had not Davey Langan been
killed, and if he had not started out to avenge him.
</p>
<p>Into his thoughts at this minute flashed a mental
picture that paled his face and brought his lips into
straight, hard lines&mdash;a picture of Barbara at the
mercy of Deveny.
</p>
<p>With a quick turn he brought Purgatory around in
front of Billy, blocking the animal&#8217;s further progress
westward. The girl started at the rapid movement,
and watched him fearfully, dreading&mdash;she knew not
what.
</p>
<p>But his smile&mdash;grim and mirthless though it was&mdash;partially
reassured her, and she sat silent, looking at
him as he spoke, rapidly, earnestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinkin&#8217; of you; an&#8217; I wasn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; mean
things&mdash;about you. I was thinkin&#8217; of Deveny&mdash;an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
of what your dad told me over there by Sentinel Rock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your dad told me that you was in danger&mdash;that
Deveny an&#8217; Strom Rogers an&#8217; some more of them had
their eyes turned on you. Your dad made me promise
that I&#8217;d come here an&#8217; look out for you&mdash;an&#8217; I mean
to do it. That&#8217;s why I went to Lamo when I had
no call to go there an&#8217; that&#8217;s why I brought Deveny
to a show-down in front of you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217; goin&#8217; on around here that ain&#8217;t
showin&#8217; on the surface&mdash;somethin&#8217; that&#8217;s hidden an&#8217;
sneakin&#8217;. You heard some of them guys in Lamo
gassin&#8217; about the &#8216;Chief&#8217; bein&#8217; one of the three that
sent your dad over the Divide.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your dad told me that, too&mdash;that there was
three of them pitched onto him. It was the fellow
they call Chief that shot your dad while he was sleepin&#8217;&mdash;when
it was too dark for your dad to see his face.
Your dad made me promise to hunt that guy up an&#8217;
square things for him. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here for.
Anyway, it&#8217;s one reason I&#8217;m here. The other reason
is that I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to see that you get a square deal from
them guys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; you won&#8217;t get a square deal ridin&#8217; out alone,
like this&mdash;especially when you head toward Sunset
Trail, where Deveny an&#8217; his gang hang out. An&#8217; I&#8217;m
settin&#8217; down hard on you ridin&#8217; that way. I&#8217;m keepin&#8217;
you from runnin&#8217; any chances.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Silently Barbara had watched Harlan&#8217;s face while
he had been talking. There was no doubt that he was
in earnest, and there was likewise no doubt that he was
concerned for her safety. But why? It seemed absurd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
that Harlan, an outlaw himself, should protect
her from other outlaws. Yet in Lamo he had done
just that.
</p>
<p>Behind his actions, his expressed concern for her,
must be a motive. What was it? Was it possible
that he was doing this thing unselfishly; that the promise
her father had exacted from him had changed him;
that in his heart at this instant dwelt those finer impulses
which must be dormant in all men, however
bad?
</p>
<p>The light of that great inquiry was in her eyes; they
searched his face for subtlety and craft and cunning&mdash;for
something that would give her a clue to his
thoughts. And when she could find in his expression
only a grave concern she pulled Billy around and
started him back toward the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>They had not ridden more than a hundred yards
before she stole a glance at Harlan.
</p>
<p>He was now riding beside her, looking straight
ahead, his face expressionless. Had he betrayed the
slightest sign of triumph she would have changed her
mind about going back to the ranchhouse with him.
</p>
<p>As it was, she felt a pulse of rage over her readiness
in yielding to his orders. Yet the rage was
softened by a lurking, stealthy joy she got out of his
masterfulness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume I may ride in another direction&mdash;east,
for instance&mdash;or north, or south?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He apparently took no notice of the mockery in her
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not be ridin&#8217; alone, anywhere,&#8221; he declared.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she returned, raising her chin and looking
at him with a cold scorn that, she thought, would embarrass
him; &#8220;I am to have a guardian.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked straight back to her, steadily, seemingly
unaffected by the hostility of her gaze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It amounts to that. But mebbe I wouldn&#8217;t put it
just that way. Somebody&#8217;s got to look out for you&mdash;to
see that you don&#8217;t go to rushin&#8217; into trouble. There
was trouble over in Lamo&mdash;if you&#8217;ll remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And now he smiled gravely at her, and her face
reddened over the memory of the incident. She had
been eager enough, then, to seek his protection; she
had trusted him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t your fault,&#8221; he went on gently.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know then, mebbe, just what kind of a
guy Deveny is. But you know now, an&#8217; it <i>would</i> be
your fault if you run into him again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He saw how she took it&mdash;how her color came and
went, and how her eyes drooped from his. He smiled
soberly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me that you&#8217;ve got to pin your faith to a
mighty small chance, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What chance?&#8221; She looked at him in startled
wonderment, for it had not occurred to her that she
faced any real danger, despite the threatening attitude
of Deveny, and her isolation. For the great, peaceful
world, and the swimming sunlight were full of the
promise of the triumph of right and virtue; and the
sturdy self-reliance of youth was in her heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What chance?&#8221; she repeated, watching him keenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The chance that me an&#8217; Red Linton will be able
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
to get things into shape to look out for you.&#8221; He
was gravely serious.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must seem a mighty slim chance to you&mdash;me
comin&#8217; here with a reputation that ain&#8217;t any too good,
an&#8217; Linton, with his red head an&#8217; his freckles. Seems
like a woman would go all wrong, pinnin&#8217; her faith to
red hair an&#8217; freckles an&#8217; a hell-raisin&#8217; outlaw. But
there&#8217;s been worse combinations, ma&#8217;am&mdash;if I do say
it myself. An&#8217; me an&#8217; Red is figurin&#8217; to come through,
no matter what you think of us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Red Linton?&#8221; she said. &#8220;That is the little, short,
red-haired man you put in Lawson&#8217;s place, isn&#8217;t it? I
have never noticed him&mdash;particularly. It seems that
I have always thought him rather unimportant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned. &#8220;That&#8217;s a trick Red&#8217;s got&mdash;seemin&#8217;
unimportant. Red spends a heap of his time
not sayin&#8217; anything, an&#8217; hangin&#8217; around lookin&#8217; like
he&#8217;s been misplaced. But when there&#8217;s any trouble,
you&#8217;ll find Red like the banty rooster that&#8217;s figurin&#8217;
to rule the roost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed him over in Pardo, ma&#8217;am&mdash;he rode
for the T Down for two or three seasons.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are anticipating trouble&mdash;with Deveny?&#8221;
she asked, a tremor in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any use of tryin&#8217; to hide it, ma&#8217;am.
Mebbe your dad thought you&#8217;d be better off by him
not mentionin&#8217; it to you. But I&#8217;ve got a different idea.
Anyone&mdash;man or woman&mdash;knows a heap more about
how to go about things if they&#8217;re sort of able to anticipate
trouble. Your dad told me things was in a mixup
over here with Deveny an&#8217; some more of his kind; an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
I ain&#8217;t aimin&#8217; to let you go ramblin&#8217; around in the dark.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About half the Rancho Seco men belong to Deveny&#8217;s
gang, Linton says. That&#8217;s why I put Linton in
Lawson&#8217;s place; an&#8217; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m askin&#8217; you to stick
pretty close to the Rancho Seco, an&#8217; requestin&#8217; you not
to go rummagin&#8217; around the country.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She rode on silently, her face pale, digesting this
disquieting news. She remembered now that her
father <i>had</i> seemed rather worried at times, and that
upon several occasions he had hinted that he was distrustful
of some of the Rancho Seco men. But as Harlan
had said, he had never taken her completely into
his confidence&mdash;no doubt because he had not wanted
her to worry. That was very like her father&mdash;always
making life easy for her.
</p>
<p>However, covertly watching Harlan, she was conscious
of an emotion that the latter did not suspect.
The emotion was confidence&mdash;not in Harlan, for,
though she had seen that he, apparently, was eager to
become her champion, she could not forget that he,
too, was an outlaw, with no proof that he had been
sent to the Rancho Seco by her father; with nothing
but his actions to convince her that his motives were
founded upon consideration for her welfare.
</p>
<p>She thought of John Haydon as she rode beside
Harlan; and it was confidence in him that was expressed
in her glances at Harlan; she was convinced
that she did not have to depend entirely upon Harlan.
And when, as they neared the ranchhouse, and she saw
a big gray horse standing near the entrance to the
<i>patio</i>, her face reddened and her eyes grew brilliant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
with a light that drew a cold smile to Harlan&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be John Haydon&#8217;s horse, I reckon,&#8221; he
said slowly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she returned, startled; &#8220;how did you
know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He rode on, not replying. When they reached the
ranchhouse, Harlan loped Purgatory toward one of
the bunkhouses, in front of which he saw Red Linton
standing. Barbara directed Billy to the <i>patio</i> entrance,
and dismounted, her face flushed, to meet a man who
came out of the open gateway to greet her, his face
wreathed in a delighted smile.
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>LINKED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;So you came at last?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara had some difficulty in keeping resentment
prominent in her voice as she faced John Haydon,
for other emotions were clamoring within her&mdash;joy
because Haydon <i>had</i> come, even though tardily;
self-reproach because she saw in Haydon&#8217;s eyes a glowing
anxiety and sympathy that looked as though they
were of recent birth.
</p>
<p>There was repressed excitement in Haydon&#8217;s manner;
it was as though he had only just heard of the
girl&#8217;s affliction and had ridden hard to come to her.
</p>
<p>She was sure of the sincerity in his voice when he
grasped her hands tightly and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;At last, Barbara! I heard it only this morning,
and I have nearly killed my horse getting over here!
Look at him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The gray horse certainly did have the appearance of
having been ridden hard. He stood, his legs braced,
his head drooping, his muzzle and chest flecked with
foam. Barbara murmured pityingly as she stroked
the beast&#8217;s neck; and there was quick forgiveness in
her eyes when she again looked at Haydon.
</p>
<p>Haydon was big&mdash;fully as tall as Harlan, and
broader. His shoulders bulged the blue flannel shirt
he wore; and it was drawn into folds at his slim
waist, where a cartridge-studded belt encircled him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
sagging at the right hip with the weight of a heavy
pistol.
</p>
<p>He wore a plain gray silk handkerchief at his
throat; it sagged at the front, revealing a muscular development
that had excited the envious admiration of
men. His hair was coal-black, wavy and abundant&mdash;though
he wore it short&mdash;with design, it seemed, for
he must have known that it gave him an alert, virile
appearance.
</p>
<p>His face, despite the tan upon it, and the little wrinkles
brought by the sun and wind, had a clear, healthy
color, and his eyes black as his hair, had a keen glint
behind which lurked humor of a quality not to be determined
at a glance&mdash;it was changeable, fleeting,
mysterious.
</p>
<p>Barbara was silent. The steady courage that had
sustained her until this instant threatened to fail her
in the presence of this big, sympathetic man who
seemed, to her, to embody that romance for which she
had always longed. She looked at him, her lips trembling
with emotion.
</p>
<p>Until now she had had no confidant&mdash;no one she
could be sure of. And so, with Haydon standing close
to her, though not too close&mdash;for he had never been
able to achieve that intimacy for which he had yearned&mdash;she
told him what had happened, including details
of her father&#8217;s death, as related to her by Harlan;
finishing by describing the incident with Deveny in
Lamo (at which Haydon muttered a threat) and the
subsequent coming of Harlan to the Rancho Seco, together
with the story of his assumption of authority.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>When she concluded Haydon laid a sympathetic
hand on her shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad, Barbara. And on top of it all, Lawson
had to play the beast, too, eh? Why didn&#8217;t you
send someone to me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no one to send.&#8221; Her voice threatened
to break, despite the brave gleam that flashed through
the moisture in her eyes. &#8220;Lawson had sent the men
away; and when they came in Harlan took charge of
them. And&mdash;besides,&#8221; she admitted, dropping her
gaze, &#8220;I&mdash;I thought you ought to&mdash;I thought you
would&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He shook her, reprovingly, laughing deeply as he
led her through the gateway into the <i>patio</i>, where they
sat on a bench for a long time, talking, while the aspect
of the <i>patio</i> began to change, becoming again a place
of cheerfulness flooded with the soft, radiant light of
returning happiness&mdash;reflected in her eyes; while the
sunlight streaming down into the enclosure took on a
brightness that made the girl&#8217;s eyes glisten; while the
drab and empty days since her father&#8217;s death began to
slip back into the limbo of memory&mdash;the sting and
the sorrow of them removed. So does the heart of
youth respond to the nearness of romance.
</p>
<p>They had been talking for half an hour when Barbara
remembered that Haydon had not expressed a
desire to meet Harlan.
</p>
<p>Haydon&#8217;s face lost a little of its color as he replied
to her suggestion that they find the man.
</p>
<p>But he laughed, rather mirthlessly, she thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I intend to see him, Barbara&mdash;but alone. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
are several things of importance that I want to say to
him&mdash;chiefly concerning his conduct toward you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up. Barbara rose also, and walked with
him, outside the gate, where he got on his horse, smiling
down at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan was right about your riding out alone. I&#8217;d
stay as close to the ranchhouse as possible. There&#8217;s
no telling what Deveny might try to do. But don&#8217;t
worry. If it wasn&#8217;t so soon after&mdash;after what has
happened&mdash;I would&mdash;&#8221; He smiled, and Barbara
knew he meant what he had said to her many times&mdash;about
there being a parson in Lazette, a hundred miles
or so northeastward&mdash;and of his eagerness to be present
with her while the parson &#8220;tied the knot.&#8221; His
manner had always been jocose, and yet she knew of
the earnestness behind it.
</p>
<p>Still, she had not yielded to his importunities, because
she had not been quite sure that she wanted him.
Nor was she certain now, though she liked him better
at this moment than she had ever liked him before.
</p>
<p>She shook her head negatively, answering his smile;
and watched him as he rode around a corner of the
ranchhouse toward the corral where, no doubt, he
would find Harlan.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Harlan had ridden directly to the bunkhouse door
and dismounted. Red Linton said nothing until Harlan
seated himself on a bench just outside the bunkhouse
door. Then Linton grinned at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a geezer come a-wooin&#8217;,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Harlan glared at the red-haired man&mdash;a truculent,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
savage glare that made Linton stretch his lips until
the corners threatened to retreat to his ears. Then
Linton assumed a deprecatory manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t no chance for <i>him</i>, I reckon. He&#8217;s
been burnin&#8217; up the breeze between here an&#8217; the Star
for more&#8217;n a year&mdash;an&#8217; she ain&#8217;t as much as kissed
him, I&#8217;d swear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan did not answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw him?&#8221; questioned Linton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut your rank mouth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Linton chuckled. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you&#8217;d been hit
that bad. Howsomever, if you <i>have</i> been, why, there&#8217;s
no sense of me wastin&#8217; time gassin&#8217; to you. They
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; will cure that complaint but petticoats an&#8217;
smiles&mdash;the which is mighty dangerous an&#8217; uncertain.
I knowed a man once&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan got up and walked to the bunkhouse. And
Linton, grinning, called loudly after him, pretending
astonishment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s gone. Disappeared complete. An&#8217; me
tryin&#8217; to jam some sense into his head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grinning, Linton sauntered away, vanishing within
the blacksmith-shop.
</p>
<p>He had hardly disappeared when Haydon appeared
from around a corner of the ranchhouse, at about the
instant Harlan, sensing the departure of Linton, came
to the door, frowning.
</p>
<p>The frown still narrowed Harlan&#8217;s eyes when they
rested upon the horseman; and his brows were drawn
together with unmistakable truculence when Haydon
dismounted near the corral fence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>Haydon&#8217;s manner had undergone a change. When
in the presence of Barbara he had been confident, nonchalant.
When he dismounted from his horse and
walked toward Harlan there was about him an atmosphere
that suggested carefulness. Before Haydon had
taken half a dozen steps Harlan was aware that the
man knew him&mdash;knew of his reputation&mdash;and feared
him.
</p>
<p>Respect was in Haydon&#8217;s eyes, in the droop of his
shoulders, in his hesitating step. And into Harlan&#8217;s
eyes came a gleam of that contempt which had always
seized him when in the presence of men who feared
him.
</p>
<p>And yet, had not Harlan possessed the faculty of
reading character at a glance; had he not had that uncanny
instinct of divining the thoughts of men who
meditated violence, he could not have known that
Haydon feared him.
</p>
<p>For Haydon&#8217;s fear was not abject. It was that
emotion which counsels caution, which warns of a
worthy antagonist, which respects force that is elemental
and destroying.
</p>
<p>Haydon smiled as he halted within a few paces of
Harlan and turned the palms of his hands outward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re &#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan, of Pardo,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Harlan nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My name&#8217;s Haydon. I own the Star&mdash;about fifteen
miles west&mdash;on Sunset Trail. I happen to be a
friend of Miss Morgan&#8217;s, and I&#8217;d like to talk with you
about the Rancho Seco.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get goin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>Haydon&#8217;s smile grew less expansive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rather difficult subject to discuss. It rather
seems to be none of my affair. But you will understand,
being interested in Barbara&#8217;s future, and in the
welfare of the ranch, why I am presuming to question
you. What do you intend to do with the ranch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; smiled Haydon. &#8220;I mean, of course,
to refer to the financial end of it. Miss Morgan will
handle the money, I suppose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got orders from Miss Barbara to gas to me
about the ranch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, I can&#8217;t say that I have. But I have a
natural desire to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be tellin&#8217; her what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon smiled faintly. Twice, during the silence
that followed Harlan&#8217;s reply, Haydon shifted his gaze
from Harlan&#8217;s face to the ground between himself and
the other, and then back again. It was plain to Haydon
that he could proceed no farther in that direction
without incurring the wrath that slumbered in Harlan&#8217;s
heart, revealed by his narrowing eyes.
</p>
<p>In Harlan&#8217;s heart was a bitter, savage passion.
Hatred for this man, which had been aroused by Barbara&#8217;s
reference to him, and intensified by his visit to
the girl, had been made malignant by his appearance
now in the rôle of inquisitor.
</p>
<p>Jealousy, Harlan would not have admitted; yet the
conviction that Haydon was handsome, and that
women would like him&mdash;that no doubt Barbara already
liked him&mdash;brought a cold rage to Harlan. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
stood, during the momentary silence, his lips curving
with contempt, his eyes glinting with a passion that was
unmistakable to Haydon.
</p>
<p>He stepped down from the doorway and walked
slowly to Haydon, coming to a halt within a yard of
him. His hands were hanging at his sides, his chin had
gone a little forward; and in his manner was the threat
that had brought a paralysis of fear to more than one
man.
</p>
<p>Yet, except for a slow stiffening of his muscles, Haydon
betrayed no fear. There was a slight smile on his
lips; his eyes met Harlan&#8217;s steadily and unblinkingly.
In them was a glint of that mysterious humor which
other men had seen in them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re lightning on the draw, Harlan,&#8221; he
said, his faint smile fading a trifle. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have
a chance with you; I&#8217;m not a gun-fighter. For that
reason I don&#8217;t want any disagreement with you. And
I&#8217;ve heard enough about you to know that you don&#8217;t
shoot unless the other fellow is out to &#8216;get&#8217; you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t have any trouble. Be fair. As the
man who will ultimately take charge of the Rancho
Seco&mdash;since Miss Barbara has been good enough to
encourage me&mdash;I would like to know some things.
I&#8217;ve heard that Lane Morgan was killed at Sentinel
Rock, and that you were with him when he died&mdash;and
just before. Did he give you authority to take charge
of the Rancho Seco?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me to take hold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A written order?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;His word.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He said nothing else; there were no papers on
him&mdash;nothing of value?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Neither man had permitted his eyes to waver from
the other&#8217;s since Harlan had advanced; and they now
stood, with only the few feet of space between them,
looking steadily at each other.
</p>
<p>Harlan saw in Haydon&#8217;s eyes a furtive, stealthy
gleam as of cupidity glossed over with a pretense of
frank curiosity. He sensed greed in Haydon&#8217;s gaze,
and knowledge of a mysterious quality.
</p>
<p>Haydon knew something about Lane Morgan&#8217;s errand
to Pardo; he knew why the man had started for
Pardo, and what had been on his person at the time of
his death.
</p>
<p>Harlan was convinced of that; and the light in his
eyes as he looked into Haydon&#8217;s reflected the distrust
and the contempt he had for the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think Morgan had in his clothes?&#8221;
he questioned suddenly.
</p>
<p>A slow flush of color stole into Haydon&#8217;s cheeks,
then receded, leaving him a trifle pale. He laughed,
with a pretense of mockery.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to know,&#8221; he said, a snarl in his voice.
&#8220;You must have searched him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned with feline mirthlessness. And he
stepped back a little, knowledge and satisfaction in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>For he had &#8220;looked Haydon over,&#8221; following Morgan&#8217;s
instructions. He had purposely permitted Haydon
to question him, expecting that during the exchange
of talk the man would say something that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
would corroborate the opinion that Harlan had instantly
formed, that Haydon was not to be trusted.
</p>
<p>And Haydon&#8217;s snarl; the cupidity in his eyes, and
his ill-veiled eagerness had convinced Harlan.
</p>
<p>Harlan did not resent Haydon&#8217;s manner; he was
too pleased over his discovery that Haydon possessed
traits of character that unfitted him for an alliance
with Barbara. And it would be his business to bring
those traits out, so that Barbara could see them unmistakably.
</p>
<p>He laughed lowly, dropping his gaze to Haydon&#8217;s
belt; to his right hand, which hung limply near his
pistol holster; and to the woolen shirt, with the silk
handkerchief at the throat sagging picturesquely.
</p>
<p>His gaze roved over Haydon&mdash;insolently, contemptuously;
his lips twitching with the grim humor
that had seized him. And Haydon stood, not moving
a muscle, undergoing the scrutiny with rigid body, with
eyes that had become wide with a queer sensation of
dread wonder that was stealing over him; and with a
pallor that was slowly becoming ghastly.
</p>
<p>For he had no doubt that at last he had unwittingly
aroused the demon in Harlan, and that violence, which
he had wished to avoid, was imminent.
</p>
<p>But Harlan&#8217;s roving gaze, as he backed slightly
away from Haydon, came to the breast-pocket of the
man&#8217;s shirt. His gaze centered there definitely, his
eyes narrowing, his muscles leaping a little.
</p>
<p>For out of the pocket stretched a gold chain, broken,
its upper end&mdash;where it entered the buttonhole of the
shirt&mdash;fastened to the buttonhole with a rawhide
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
thong, as though the gold section were not long enough
to reach.
</p>
<p>And the gold section of the chain was of the peculiar
pattern of the section that Harlan had picked up on
the desert near Sentinel Rock.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>DEEP WATER</h3>
</div>

<p>Despite his conviction that he stood in the presence
of the mysterious &#8220;Chief&#8221; of whom he had
heard much, Harlan&#8217;s expression did not change.
There was a new interest added to it, and a deeper
glow in his eyes. But he gave no outward evidence of
surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I searched him,&#8221; he said, answering Haydon&#8217;s
charge. &#8220;If I found anything on him I&#8217;m turnin&#8217;
it over to Barbara Morgan&mdash;or hangin&#8217; onto it.
That&#8217;s my business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon laughed, for Harlan&#8217;s voice had broken the
tension that had come with the interval of threatening
silence.
</p>
<p>Since he could not induce Harlan to divulge anything
of interest there was nothing to do but to withdraw
as gracefully as possible. And he backed away,
smiling, saying placatively:
</p>
<p>&#8220;No offense intended, Harlan. I was merely curious
on Barbara&#8217;s account.&#8221; He mounted his horse,
urged it along the corral fence, and sent back a
smiling:
</p>
<p>&#8220;So-long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Motionless, still standing where he had stood when
Haydon climbed on his horse, Harlan watched while
the man rode the short distance to the house. At the
corner around which he had appeared some minutes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
before, Haydon brought his horse to a halt, waved a
hand&mdash;at Barbara, Harlan supposed&mdash;and then rode
on, heading westward toward Sunset Trail.
</p>
<p>Harlan watched him until he had penetrated far into
the big valley; then he turned, slowly, and sought
Red Linton&mdash;finding him in the blacksmith-shop.
</p>
<p>Later in the day&mdash;after Harlan and Linton had
talked long, standing in the door of the blacksmith-shop&mdash;Linton
mounted his horse and rode to where
Harlan stood.
</p>
<p>Linton was prepared for a long ride. Folded in
the slicker that was strapped to the cantle of his saddle
was food; he carried his rifle in the saddle sheath, and
a water-bag bulged above the horse&#8217;s withers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t find all the T Down boys yearnin&#8217; to
bust into this ruckus,&#8221; Harlan said as he stood near
Linton&#8217;s horse as Linton grinned down at him; &#8220;but
there&#8217;ll be some. Put it right up to them that it ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to be no pussy-kitten job, an&#8217; that it&#8217;s likely some
of them won&#8217;t ever see the T Down again. But to
offset that, you can tell &#8217;em that if we make good, the
Rancho Seco will owe them a heap&mdash;an&#8217; they&#8217;ll get
what&#8217;s comin&#8217; to them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He watched while Linton rode eastward over the
big level; then he grinned and walked to the ranchhouse,
going around the front and standing in the wide
gateway where he saw Barbara sitting on a bench
in the <i>patio</i>, staring straight ahead, meditatively, unaware
that he was standing in the gateway, watching
her.
</p>
<p>Harlan watched the girl for a long time&mdash;until she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
turned and saw him. Then she blushed and stood up,
looking at him in slight wonderment as he came toward
her and stood within a few feet of her.
</p>
<p>On Harlan&#8217;s face was a slow, genial grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunnin&#8217; yourself, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a
mighty nice day&mdash;not too hot. Have you knowed
him long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The startling irrelevance of the question caused
Barbara to gaze sharply at Harlan, and when their
eyes met she noted that his were twinkling with a light
that she could not fathom. She hated him when she
could not understand him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Haydon, do you mean?&#8221; she questioned, a
sudden coldness in her voice.
</p>
<p>Harlan nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A little more than a year, I think. It was just
after I returned from school, at Denver.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He watched her, saying lowly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it was Denver. I&#8217;d been wonderin&#8217;. I knowed
it must have been some place. Schoolin&#8217; is a thing
that I never had time to monkey with&mdash;I reckon my
folks didn&#8217;t believe a heap in &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve lived in the West all your life&mdash;you were
born in the West, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He looked keenly at her. &#8220;I expect you knowed
that without askin&#8217;. I&#8217;ve been wonderin&#8217; if it would
have made any difference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In me. Do you think an education makes a man
act different&mdash;gives him different ideas about his actions&mdash;in
his dealin&#8217;s with women, for instance?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I expect it does. Education should make a man
more considerate of women&mdash;it is refining.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you reckon a man that ain&#8217;t had any education
is coarse, an&#8217; don&#8217;t know how to treat a woman?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that; I said education <i>should</i> make a
man treat women that way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it don&#8217;t always?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. I have known men&mdash;well educated
men&mdash;who failed to treat women as they should be
treated.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that ain&#8217;t what you might call a hard-an&#8217;-fast
rule&mdash;it don&#8217;t always work. An&#8217; there&#8217;s hope for
any man who ain&#8217;t had schoolin&#8217;&mdash;if he&#8217;s wantin&#8217; to be
a man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But an educated man can&#8217;t claim ignorance when
he aims to mistreat a woman. That&#8217;s how it figures
up, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She laughed. &#8220;It would seem to point to that conclusion.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve knowed Haydon about a year? I reckon
he&#8217;s educated?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She watched him closely, wondering at his
meaning&mdash;why he had brought Haydon&#8217;s name into
the discussion. She was marveling at the subtle light
in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father liked Haydon&mdash;he told me Haydon
was the only square man in the country&mdash;besides himself
an&#8217; Sheriff Gage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father liked Haydon. I&#8217;m beginning to believe
you really <i>did</i> have a talk with father before he died!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;Goin&#8217; back to Haydon. I had a talk
with him a little while ago. I sort of took a shine to
him.&#8221; He drew from a pocket the section of gold
chain he had found on the desert, holding it out to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a piece of Haydon&#8217;s watch chain,&#8221; he said
slowly, watching her face. &#8220;The next time Haydon
comes to see you, give it to him, tellin&#8217; him I found it.
It&#8217;s likely he&#8217;ll ask you where I found it. But you can
say I wasn&#8217;t mentionin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned, looking back over his shoulder at her as
he walked toward the gate.
</p>
<p>She stood, holding the glittering links in the palm
of one hand, doubt and suspicion in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she called after him; &#8220;he was just here,
and you say you talked with him! Why didn&#8217;t you
give it to him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgot it, ma&#8217;am. An&#8217; I reckon you&#8217;ll be seein&#8217;
him before I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he strode out through the gate, leaving her to
speculate upon the mystery of his words and his odd
action in leaving the chain with her when he could
have personally returned it to Haydon.
</p>
<p>Harlan, however, was grinning as he returned to
the bunkhouse. For he wanted Barbara to see Haydon&#8217;s
face when the section of chain was returned to
him, to gain whatever illumination she could from the
incident. He did not care to tell her&mdash;yet&mdash;that
Haydon had killed her father; but he did desire to
create in her mind a doubt of Haydon, so that she
would hesitate to confide to him everything that happened
at the Rancho Seco.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>For himself, he wanted to intimate delicately to
Haydon his knowledge of what had really occurred at
Sentinel Rock; it was a message to the man conveying
a significance that Haydon could not mistake. It
meant that for some reason, known only to himself,
Harlan did not intend to tell what he knew.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>FORGING A LETTER</h3>
</div>

<p>The impulse which had moved Harlan to send
Red Linton to the T Down ranch to enlist the
services of some of his old friends had resulted from a
conviction that he could not depend upon those men
of the Rancho Seco outfit who had seemed to him, to
be unfriendly to Stroud, the straw-boss. He knew
nothing about them, and their loyalty to Barbara Morgan
might be of a quality that would not endure
through the sort of trouble that seemed to be imminent.
</p>
<p>The T Down men&mdash;those who would come&mdash;would
stand with him no matter what happened&mdash;they
would do his will without question.
</p>
<p>There was no doubt in Harlan&#8217;s mind that John
Haydon was the mysterious &#8220;Chief&#8221;&mdash;the man who
had sent into Lane Morgan&#8217;s breast the bullet that had
ultimately killed him; and there was no doubt that
some powerful, secret force was at work in the country,
and that the force was directing its attention to
the Rancho Seco and the defenseless girl who was at
the nominal head of it. For some reason the secret
force had killed her father, had isolated the ranch, had
encompassed it with enemies, and was working slowly
and surely to enmesh the girl herself.
</p>
<p>Harlan was convinced that one of the motives behind
the subtle aggressions of the men was a yearning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
for the gold that Morgan had left&mdash;in fact the presence
of Dolver and Laskar at Sentinel Rock&mdash;and
Morgan&#8217;s word to him about the gold&mdash;provided
sufficient evidence on that score.
</p>
<p>They had watched Morgan; they suspected he was
taking gold to Pardo to have it assayed, and they had
killed him in the hope of finding something on his person
which would reveal to them where he had hidden
the rest of it.
</p>
<p>One other motive was that of the eternal, ages-old
passion of a man for woman. Evidence of that passion
had been revealed to Harlan at Lamo, by the attack
on Barbara by Deveny&#8217;s hireling&mdash;Higgins; by
the subtle advances of John Haydon. It seemed to
Harlan that all of these men had been&mdash;and were&mdash;equally
determined to possess the girl.
</p>
<p>And yet back of it all&mdash;behind that which had been
rendered visible by the actions of the man and by Harlan&#8217;s
own deductions&mdash;was something else&mdash;something
stealthy and hidden; a secret threat of dire things
to come&mdash;a lingering promise of trickery.
</p>
<p>Standing at one of the gates of the corral upon the
third morning following Linton&#8217;s departure, Harlan
considered this phase of the situation. He felt the
hidden threat of something sinister that lurked in the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>It was all around him. It seemed to lie secreted in
the yawning space that engulfed the Rancho Seco&mdash;south,
north, and east. From the haze that stretched
into the unending distance westward it seemed to come,
bearing its whispered promise. The solemn hills that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
flanked the wide stretches of Sunset Valley seemed to
hint of it&mdash;somberly.
</p>
<p>Mystery was in the serene calm that seemed to
encompass the big basin; from the far reaches westward,
in the misty veil that seemed to hang from the
far-flung shafts of sunlight that penetrated the fleecy
clouds, came the sinister threat&mdash;the whole section
seemed to pulse with it.
</p>
<p>And yet Harlan knew there could be no mystery
except the mysteries of men. Nature was the same
here as in any other section of the world, and her
secrets were not more profound than usual.
</p>
<p>He grinned mirthlessly at the wonderful basin, noting
that the Rancho Seco buildings seemed to lie on a
direct line with its center; that the faint trail that ran
through the basin&mdash;the trail men traveled&mdash;came on
in its undulating way straight toward the Rancho Seco
ranchhouse, seemed to bring the mystery of the big
basin with it; seemed to be a link that connected the
Rancho Seco with the promise of trouble.
</p>
<p>That impression might have engaged the serious
thoughts of some men. It widened the smile on Harlan&#8217;s
face. For he knew there was no threat in the
beauty of the valley; that it did not hide its secrets
from the prying eyes of men. Whatever secret the
valley held was in the minds of men&mdash;the minds of
Deveny and the mysterious &#8220;Chief,&#8221; and their followers.
</p>
<p>Harlan had not absented himself from the ranchhouse
since the departure of Linton. He had lounged
in the vicinity of the buildings during the day&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
Barbara had seen him many times from the windows;
and he had spent his nights watching the ranchhouse,
half expecting another attack on Barbara.
</p>
<p>The girl had seen him at night, too; and she had
smiled at the picture he made with the moonlight shining
upon him&mdash;or standing in some shadow&mdash;somber,
motionless, undoubtedly guarding her.
</p>
<p>She saw him this morning, too, as he stood beside
the corral gate, and there was a glow in her eyes that,
had he seen it, might have thrilled him with its gratitude.
</p>
<p>She came out of a rear door after a while, and Harlan
was still standing at the gate.
</p>
<p>He watched her as she came toward him&mdash;it was
the first time she had ventured in that direction since
the return from Lamo with him&mdash;noting that she
seemed to be in better spirits&mdash;that she was smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You looked lonesome,&#8221; she said, as she halted near
him. &#8220;Did Linton join the outfit?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s likely; he went three days ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew he had gone; I saw you several times, and
you were always alone. And,&#8221; she added, looking
keenly at him; &#8220;I saw you several times, at night.
Don&#8217;t you ever sleep?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;m a sort of restless cuss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her face took on serious lines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Harlan,&#8221; she said, reprovingly, &#8220;you
are keeping something back. You have been watching
the ranchhouse at night&mdash;and during the day. You
are guarding me. Why is it? Do you think I am
going to run away?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;From me?&#8221; he queried; &#8220;I was hopin&#8217; you
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stiffened with exasperation, for she felt the insincerity
in his manner&mdash;caught the humorous note in
his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are treating me as you would treat a child,&#8221;
she declared; &#8220;and I won&#8217;t have it. Are you watching
me because you fear there might be another&mdash;Lawson?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! There isn&#8217;t another man in the section
would dare what Lawson dared!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen&mdash;eh?&#8221; he said, tauntingly. &#8220;Well,
I&#8217;ve nosed around quite considerable, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t remember
to have ever run into a place where there was
fewer <i>men</i> than in this neck of the woods.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are plenty of gentlemen. Do you think
John Haydon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned faintly. &#8220;He&#8217;s been fannin&#8217; it right
along for half an hour,&#8221; he said, with seeming irrelevance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; she asked, with a swift, uncomprehending
glance at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your gentleman,&#8221; he said slowly.
</p>
<p>She followed the direction of his gaze, and saw, on
the trail that led downward from a little table-land to
the level that stretched toward the ranchhouse, a horseman,
coming rapidly toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Haydon!&#8221; she ejaculated, her voice leaping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; said Harlan, dryly. He looked keenly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
at her, noting the flush on her face, the brightness of
her eyes. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t forgettin&#8217; to give him that piece
of chain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, drawing the glittering links from
a pocket of her skirt; &#8220;I have it here. You may return
it to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me an&#8217; Haydon ain&#8217;t on speakin&#8217; terms,&#8221; he
smiled. &#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t appreciate it none, if I give it
to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&#8221; she began, only to pause and look at him
with a sudden comprehension in her eyes. For into
Harlan&#8217;s face had come an expression that, she
thought, she could analyze. It was jealousy. That
was why he was reluctant to return the chain to Haydon.
</p>
<p>The situation was so positively puerile, she thought,
that she almost felt like laughing. She would have
laughed had it not been that she knew of Harlan&#8217;s unfailing
vigilance&mdash;and that she felt differently toward
him now than she had felt during the first days of
their acquaintance. His steadfast vigilance, she decided,
must have been responsible for the change, together
with the steady consideration he revealed for
her.
</p>
<p>At any rate, something about him had affected her.
She felt more gentle toward him; more inclined to believe
in him; and there had been times during the past
few days when she had been astonished at the subtle,
warm sensation that had stolen over her whenever she
saw him or whenever she thought of him.
</p>
<p>Something of that warmth toward him was in her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
eyes now as she watched him and she decided that she
should humor his whim; that she should perform the
action that he was reluctant to perform.
</p>
<p>She smiled, with the wisdom of a woman to whom a
secret had been unwittingly revealed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like Haydon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Him an&#8217; me ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be bosom friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you like him?&#8221; she asked banteringly.
</p>
<p>She thought his grin was brazen. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
like me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said coldly. But her face reddened
a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he laughed; &#8220;that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t like Haydon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon had crossed the big level, and was close to
the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>The girl had determined to remain where she was,
to return the piece of chain to Haydon in the presence
of Harlan&mdash;in order to learn what she could of the
depth of Harlan&#8217;s dislike for Haydon when in the
presence of the latter. And so a silence came between
them as they watched Haydon ride toward them.
</p>
<p>When Haydon rode close to them he halted his
horse and sat in the saddle, an expression of cold inquiry
on his face. His smile at Miss Barbara was a
trifle forced; his glance at Harlan had a fair measure
of frank dislike and suspicion in it.
</p>
<p>Harlan deliberately turned his back toward Barbara
and Haydon when the latter dismounted; walked a
little distance, and pretended to be interested in a snubbing
post in the corral.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>Yet he cast furtive glances toward the two, and
when he saw the girl reaching into a pocket for the
section of chain he had given her, he slowly sauntered
forward, and was within hearing distance when Barbara
spoke to Haydon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was to give you this,&#8221; she said&mdash;and she extended
a hand toward Haydon, the chain dangling
from her fingers.
</p>
<p>Harlan saw Haydon&#8217;s muscles leap and become
tense. He saw the man&#8217;s color go, saw his cheeks
whiten; observed that his eyes widened and gleamed
with mingled astonishment and alarm.
</p>
<p>He regained control of himself instantly, however,
but Harlan had seen enough to strengthen his convictions,
and he grinned as Haydon flashed a sharp glance
at him.
</p>
<p>Barbara, too, had noted the strange light in Haydon&#8217;s
eyes; she had seen that Haydon had seemed
about to shrink from the chain when she held it out to
him. She looked from Haydon to Harlan inquiringly
and when her glance again returned to Haydon he
was smiling.
</p>
<p>However, he had not taken the chain from her
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it yours?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;mine,&#8221; he answered, hesitatingly. &#8220;Where
did you find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Harlan found it.&#8221; Barbara noted Haydon&#8217;s
quick start, the searching glance he gave Harlan&mdash;who
was now leaning on a rail of the corral fence,
seemingly uninterested.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>Haydon laughed, a little hoarsely, it seemed to
Barbara, and more loudly than the occasion seemed to
demand. She thought, though, that the laugh might
have been a jeer for Harlan&#8217;s action in turning the
chain over to her instead of returning it directly to
the owner.
</p>
<p>She did not catch the searching inquiry of Haydon&#8217;s
glance at Harlan, nor did she see Harlan&#8217;s odd smile
at Haydon, and the slow wink that accompanied it.
</p>
<p>But the wink and the smile conveyed to Haydon the
intelligence that Harlan knew the story connected with
the loss of the chain, and that he had not communicated
it to the girl. They also expressed to Haydon
the message that Harlan and Haydon were kindred
souls&mdash;the smile and the wink told Haydon that this
man who knew his secret was secretly applauding him,
even while inwardly laughing at him for his fear that
the secret would be betrayed.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s voice broke a short silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Found it right about here&mdash;the other day. It
must have laid there a long time, for it took a heap
of polishin&#8217; to brighten it up.&#8221; Again he closed an eye
at Haydon, and the latter grinned broadly.
</p>
<p>Barbara silently endured a pang of disappointment.
She had caught Harlan&#8217;s wink. The man had betrayed
jealousy only a few minutes ago, and he had
refused personally to return the chain to Haydon.
And yet he stood there now, smiling and winking at
the other, evidently with the desire to ingratiate himself.
Sycophant, weakling, or fool&mdash;which was he?
She shuddered with disgust, deliberately turned her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
back to Harlan, and began to walk toward the ranchhouse,
Haydon following.
</p>
<p>And Harlan, standing at the fence, leaned an elbow
on one of the rails and watched the two, an enigmatic
smile on his face.
</p>
<p>For he had succeeded in opening a gate which disclosed
a trail that would lead him straight to the
mystery, a breath of which had been borne to him that
morning upon the slight breeze that had swept down
to him from the mighty valley out of which Haydon
had ridden.
</p>
<p>Between him and Haydon a bond had been established,
fashioned from the links of the section of chain.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HARLAN RIDES ALONE</h3>
</div>

<p>Upon the morning of the fourth day following
Haydon&#8217;s visit to the Rancho Seco, a dust cloud
developed on the northwestern horizon. Harlan observed
the cloud; he had been watching for it since
dawn, when he had emerged from the stable door,
where he had been looking after Purgatory.
</p>
<p>From the ranchhouse Barbara also saw the cloud,
and she ran upstairs to one of the north windows.
There, with her face pressed against the glass, she
watched the cloud grow in size, observed that it was
dotted with the forms of horsemen; saw at last that
the horsemen were headed straight for the Rancho
Seco. Then, wondering, anxious, eager, she descended
the stairs and ran out to where Harlan was standing,
speaking breathlessly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean? Who are they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be Red Linton an&#8217; some T Down boys.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;T Down&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardo men. From where I used to work. I sent
Linton for them. If I&#8217;m going to run a ranch I aim to
run it with men I can depend on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She had hardly spoken to him in the four days that
had elapsed since Haydon&#8217;s last visit, for the disgust
she had felt that day had endured. But there was
something new in his manner now&mdash;a briskness, a
business-like air that made her look sharply at him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>He smiled at her, and in the smile was a snapping
humor that puzzled her.
</p>
<p>She stood, watching for a while&mdash;until the group
of horsemen became clearly defined&mdash;and then, with
a sudden fear that the men might be outlaws of the
same type as Harlan&mdash;possibly he had sent for them
because they were&mdash;she returned to the ranchhouse
and watched from one of the windows.
</p>
<p>When the T Down men rode up to the corral gate
they dismounted and surrounded Harlan. There were
ten of them&mdash;rugged-looking fellows of various ages,
bepistoled, begrimed with dust, and articulate with profane
expressions of delight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell&#8217;s a-poppin&#8217;, Red says!&#8221; yelled one. &#8220;He
says there&#8217;s geezers here which is pinin&#8217; for yore gore.
Turn me loose on &#8217;em&mdash;oh, turn me loose!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men, tired, dusty, and hungry, swarmed into
one of the bunkhouses immediately after they had
turned their horses into the corral and cared for their
saddles.
</p>
<p>The men were in good spirits, despite their long
ride; and for half an hour after they descended upon
the bunkhouse the air pulsed with their talk and their
laughter, as they washed their dust-stained faces from
the tin washbasin on the bench outside the door, and
combed their hair with a comb attached to a rawhide
thong that swung from the wall above the basin.
</p>
<p>They had been informed by Red Linton regarding
the situation that had developed at the Rancho Seco&mdash;fully
informed before they had begun their trip
westward&mdash;Linton scrupulously and faithfully presenting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
to them the dangers that confronted them. And
though some of them were still curious, and sought a
word with Harlan in confirmation, they seemed to be
satisfied to trust to Harlan&#8217;s judgment. Their faith
was of the kind that needs but little verbal reassurance.
</p>
<p>That they admired the man who had sent for them
there was little doubt; for they watched him with
glowing eyes as he talked with them, revealing their
pride that they had been selected. Hardy, clear-eyed,
serenely unafraid, they instantly adapted themselves to
the new &#8220;job,&#8221; and before their first meal was finished
they were thoroughly at home.
</p>
<p>Shortly afterward&mdash;while the men were lounging
about inside&mdash;Harlan drew Linton outside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the bunch I would have picked if I had gone
myself,&#8221; complimented Harlan. &#8220;I&#8217;m thankin&#8217; you a
heap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He whispered to Linton the story of Haydon&#8217;s last
visit and for the first time Linton heard about the section
of chain which convicted Haydon of the murder
of Lane Morgan. Linton&#8217;s eyes gleamed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always sort of suspected the son-of-a-gun!&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;An&#8217; him makin&#8217; love to Barbara! The
sneakin&#8217; coyote! An&#8217; so you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to see him? I&#8217;d
be a whole lot careful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s smile was grave. &#8220;I&#8217;m reckonin&#8217; to be.
I&#8217;d have gone before this, but I was waitin&#8217; for you
boys. Nobody is sayin&#8217; anything to anybody. You&#8217;re
stickin&#8217; close to the Rancho Seco, not lettin&#8217; Barbara
out of your sight. That&#8217;s what I wanted you an&#8217; the
other guys for. I&#8217;m playin&#8217; the rest of it a lone hand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>Leaving Linton standing near the bunkhouse, he
went to the stable, where he threw saddle and bridle on
Purgatory. Then he mounted, waved a hand at Linton,
who was watching him, and rode to the ranchhouse.
At the northwest corner&mdash;around which Haydon
had ridden on the occasion of his last visit&mdash;he
brought Purgatory to a halt, for he saw Barbara just
emerging from the <i>patio</i> gate.
</p>
<p>She halted in the opening when she observed him;
making a picture that was vivid in his memory for
many days afterward&mdash;for her eyes were alight with
wonder, her cheeks were flushed, and she was breathing
fast.
</p>
<p>For she had watched from a window the coming of
the T Down men; she had noted the conference between
Harlan and Linton; and she had seen Harlan
waving a hand at the red-haired man, seemingly in
farewell. She stood now, afflicted with a strange regret,
suddenly aware that she would feel the absence of
the man who sat on his horse before her&mdash;for she
divined that he was going.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sayin&#8217; so-long to you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; smiled Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, aware of the flatness of her tone.
&#8220;Are you going away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m figurin&#8217; to go. I ain&#8217;t used to hangin&#8217; around
one place very long. But I&#8217;m comin&#8217; back some day.
Red Linton an&#8217; the boys will be seein&#8217; that things
go smooth with you. You can depend on Red, and
all the boys. They&#8217;re Simon-pure, dyed-in-the-wool,
eighteen-carat men.&#8221; And now he grinned, gravely.
&#8220;Remember this, Barbara: A man will do things when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
he&#8217;s handlin&#8217; a gold chain&mdash;things that he wouldn&#8217;t
do if there didn&#8217;t happen to be any chain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He doffed his hat and slapped Purgatory sharply,
heading the animal westward, toward the yawning
mouth of the big basin that stretched its mighty length
into the mystery of distance.
</p>
<p>But his words left her with a conviction that she had
again misjudged him, and that when he had appeared
to fawn on Haydon he had been merely acting, merely
pretending. She watched him, regretfully, longingly,
assailed by emotions that she could not understand&mdash;until
he and Purgatory grew small in the gulf of distance;
until horse and rider were swallowed in the
glowing haze.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>HARLAN JOINS THE GANG</h3>
</div>

<p>At the edge of the big level, where it merged
into the floor of the basin, Harlan drew Purgatory
to a halt. For an instant he sat in the saddle
scrutinizing a section of buffalo grass that fringed a
clump of willows near the almost dry bed of the river
that doubled slightly as it came from the basin. Something
in the appearance of the grass had attracted his
attention&mdash;it was matted, as though something had
lain or rolled in it.
</p>
<p>He rode closer, cautiously, for the little trees formed
a covert behind which any one of several dangers
might lie concealed&mdash;and looked down at the grass.
As he examined the place his lips twisted into a grim
smile, and his eyes grew bright with comprehension.
</p>
<p>He rode around the clump of trees, making sure
it was not occupied; then he dismounted.
</p>
<p>Someone had been concealed in the covert for many
days&mdash;a man. For he saw the imprints of heels, and
indentations where spurs had gashed the earth. The
marks were all fresh&mdash;recently made. While he
watched he saw some blades of the long grass slowly
rise&mdash;as though, relieved from some pressure that had
been upon them, they were eager to regain an upright
position. He also saw scraps of food&mdash;jerked beef
and biscuit&mdash;scattered here and there.
</p>
<p>He frowned, convinced that for days a man had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
occupied the covert, watching the Rancho Seco; convinced
also, that the mystery he had sensed some days
ago had been man-made, as he had felt. The man
who had been there had been a sentinel, a spy, sent by
Deveny or Haydon to observe his movements, and to
report them, of course, to one or the other of the two
outlaws.
</p>
<p>Harlan remounted Purgatory. His caution had not
been wasted, and his vigilance in guarding the ranchhouse
must have been irritating to the man who had
been watching.
</p>
<p>He urged Purgatory on again&mdash;heading him westward,
as before. And when he reached the crest of a
slight rise in the valley&mdash;from where he could see the
trail as it twisted and undulated around hills and into
depressions&mdash;he saw, far up the valley&mdash;and yet not
so far, either&mdash;not more than two miles&mdash;a horseman,
riding slowly&mdash;away from him.
</p>
<p>The horseman was the spy, of course. Harlan had
no doubt that if he lingered in the vicinity of the covert
long enough he would discover the place where the
horse had been concealed. But that was not important,
now that he had discovered enough to satisfy
himself that there had been a spy&mdash;and so he rode on,
smiling faintly, knowing that the rider was headed
into the valley&mdash;possibly to the outlaw rendezvous
to appraise Deveny and the others of his coming.
</p>
<p>The trail was clearly defined, and there were places
where it ran over broad levels of grass where he presented
a good target to men who might be eager to
send a shot at him. There were other spots where the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
trail led into timber clumps and through tangles of
brush where an ambuscade might be planned in perfect
safety by an enemy; and there were the bastioned cliffs
that towered above the trail at intervals, offering admirable
hinding-places for any man with hostile intentions.
</p>
<p>Harlan, however, rode steadily, outwardly unconcerned;
inwardly convinced that no attempt would be
made to ambush him. For Haydon has passed that
way on his return to the Star, and Harlan had no
doubt that since the incident of the smile and the wink,
Haydon had passed word that he was not to be
molested.
</p>
<p>Haydon would be curious&mdash;as he had been curious
at the Rancho Seco&mdash;to learn the significance of the
smile and the wink. Haydon would want to discover
just how much Harlan knew about the murder of Lane
Morgan; and he would want to know what Harlan
knew of the gold that Morgan had secreted. And so
Harlan rode on, watching the country through which
he passed, but feeling assured there would be no shot
to greet him from one of the many natural vantage-points
he encountered.
</p>
<p>He rode for an hour, not making very good time,
for it was a new trail, and he was examining the country
intently as he passed, fixing it in his memory for future
convenience, perhaps&mdash;no one ever knew just when it
might be necessary to use one&#8217;s knowledge&mdash;when he
reached a low ridge which crossed the valley.
</p>
<p>Here he halted Purgatory and gazed about him.
</p>
<p>Before him stretched a green grass level, about two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
miles long, running the entire width of the valley. It
was dotted with mesquite, sage, and here and there
the thorny blade of a cactus rose. Some cattle were
grazing on the level; they were several miles south,
and he could see some horsemen near them.
</p>
<p>He decided he must be close to the Star; and he
urged Purgatory on again, down upon the level, toward
some timber that grew at the farther edge of the
level. Just as he slipped down the slope of the ridge,
he saw, far ahead of him, the horseman he had seen
when he had entered the valley. The horseman was
on the crest of a bald hill&mdash;low, and small&mdash;but
Harlan caught a glimpse of him as he crossed it, riding
fast.
</p>
<p>Harlan smiled again, and rode on his way, resuming
his scrutiny of the country.
</p>
<p>The valley was mighty, magnificent; it deserved all
the praise Barbara Morgan had heaped upon it.
From the low mountain range on the north to the
taller mountains southward, it was a virgin paradise
in which reigned a peace so profound that it brought
a reverent awe into the soul of the beholder.
</p>
<p>It thrilled Harlan despite the certain blasé, matter-of-fact
attitude he had for all of nature&#8217;s phenomena;
he found himself admiring the majestic buttes that
fringed it; there was a glint of appreciation in his eyes
for the colossal bigness of it&mdash;for the gigantic, sweeping
curves which seemed to make of it an oblong bowl,
a cosmic hollow, boundless, hinting of the infinite
power of its builder.
</p>
<p>The trail that ran through it, drawled to threadlike
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
proportions by the mightiness of the space through
which it ran, was, for the greater part of the distance
traveled by Harlan, a mere scratch upon a low rock
ridge. And as he rode he could look down upon the
floor of the valley, green and inviting.
</p>
<p>When he entered the timber at the edge of the grass
level, he was conscious of a stealthy sound behind him.
He turned quickly in the saddle, to see a man standing
at the edge of some brush that fringed the trail.
</p>
<p>The man was big, a heavy black beard covered his
chin and portions of his cheeks; his hat was drawn
well down over his forehead, partially shielding his
eyes.
</p>
<p>A rifle in his hands was held loosely, and though it
appeared that the man did not intend to use the
weapon immediately, Harlan could see that his right
forefinger was touching the trigger, and that the
muzzle of the weapon was suggestively toward him.
</p>
<p>For the past few miles of his ride Harlan had been
expecting an apparition of this sort to appear, and so
he now gave no sign of surprise. Instead, he slowly
raised both hands until they were on a level with his
shoulders&mdash;and, still twisted about in the saddle, he
grinned faintly at the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;From now on I&#8217;m to have company, eh?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>The man smirked grimly at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve hit it,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;You&#8217;re Harlan,
ain&#8217;t you? &#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan, the Pardo two-gun man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s eyes were glowing with interest&mdash;critical,
almost cynical, and they roved over Harlan with
a probing intensity that left no doubt in Harlan&#8217;s mind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
that the man had heard of him and was examining him
with intent to discover what sort of a character he was.
</p>
<p>Apparently satisfied&mdash;and also plainly impressed
with what he saw, the man grinned&mdash;this time almost
genially&mdash;and answered Harlan&#8217;s affirmative nod
with:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Haydon is expectin&#8217; you. You c&#8217;n let your
paws down&mdash;takin&#8217; a heap of care not to go to foolin&#8217;
with your guns. I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; them; Haydon didn&#8217;t
say anything about it. You&#8217;re ridin&#8217; that trail that
forks off to the left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan lowered his hands, resting them on the pommel
of his saddle, and rode on, taking, as advised, a
narrow trail that diverged from the other a short distance
from where he had met the man. As he struck
the other trail he heard the man coming behind him&mdash;on
a horse.
</p>
<p>There were no further words. Harlan kept to the
trail, riding slowly; the man behind him following at a
short distance.
</p>
<p>In this manner they rode for perhaps a mile. Then
the timber grew sparse, and Purgatory and his rider at
last emerged upon a level that extended about a hundred
feet and then sloped down abruptly to another
level, through which flowed a narrow stream of water,
shallow and clear.
</p>
<p>Close to the bank of the stream was an adobe ranchhouse,
and surrounding it were several other buildings.
At a slight distance from the house was a corral in
which were several horses. In front of a bunkhouse
were several men who, when they saw Harlan and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
other man coming, faced toward them and stood, motionless,
watching.
</p>
<p>The men maintained silence as Harlan rode to the
ranchhouse and sat in the saddle, awaiting the pleasure
of his escort. He saw the latter grin at the other men
as he passed them; and he grinned at Harlan as he
brought his horse to a halt near Purgatory and dismounted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re to git off an&#8217; visit,&#8221; he said; &#8220;Haydon
is inside.&#8221; As he dismounted and trailed the reins
over the head of his beast he cast a sharp, critical eye
over Purgatory.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a heap of hoss in that black, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty.&#8221; Harlan got down and ran a hand over
Purgatory&#8217;s neck, while trailing the reins over his
head. &#8220;Man-killer,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch him.
He ain&#8217;t been rode by nobody but me, an&#8217; he won&#8217;t
stand for nobody foolin&#8217; around him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan had raised his voice until he was sure the
men in front of the bunkhouse heard him; then he
grinned genially at them all and followed the black-bearded
man into the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>An instant later, in a big room which had the appearance
of an office, Harlan was confronting Haydon.
</p>
<p>The latter was sitting in a chair at a desk, and when
Harlan entered Haydon got up and grinned at him,
shallowly, without mirth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you got here,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been expecting
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been notin&#8217; that. That guy you left at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
edge of the level to keep an eye on the Rancho Seco
didn&#8217;t cover his tracks. I run onto them&mdash;an&#8217; I saw
him hittin&#8217; the breeze&mdash;comin&#8217; here. I reckon nobody
is surprised.&#8221; Harlan grinned widely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you noticed that,&#8221; said Haydon, answering
Harlan&#8217;s grin. &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t mind admitting that
we&#8217;ve kept an eye on you. You&#8217;ve had me guessing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon&#8217;s manner was that of the man who is careful
not to say too much, his constraint was of the quality
that hints of a desire to become confidential&mdash;a
smooth, bland courtesy; a flattering voice&mdash;encouraging,
suggesting frankness.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s manner was that of a certain reckless carelessness.
He seemed to be perfectly at ease, confident,
deliberate, and unwatchful. He knew Haydon was an
outlaw; that the men who had been grouped in front
of the bunkhouse were members of Haydon&#8217;s band; he
knew the man who had escorted him to the Star had
been deliberately stationed in the timber to watch for
him. And he had no doubt that other outlaws had
lain concealed along the trail to observe his movements.
</p>
<p>He knew, too, that he had placed himself in a precarious
predicament&mdash;that his life was in danger, and
that he must be exceedingly careful.
</p>
<p>Yet outwardly he was cool, composed. With Haydon&#8217;s
eyes upon him he drew a chair to a point near
the desk, seated himself in it, drew out paper and tobacco,
and rolled a cigarette. Lighting it, he puffed
slowly, watching while Haydon dropped into the chair
he had vacated at Harlan&#8217;s appearance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>When Haydon dropped into his chair he grinned
admiringly at Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a cool one, Harlan,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to
say that for you. But there&#8217;s no use in four-flushing.
You&#8217;ve come here to tell me something about the
chain. Where did you find it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At Sentinel Rock&mdash;not far from where you
plugged Lane Morgan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re assuming that I shot Morgan?&#8221; charged
Haydon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan was assumin&#8217;, too, I reckon,&#8221; grinned
Harlan. &#8220;He told me it was you who shot him&mdash;he
saw your face by the flash of your gun. An&#8217; he told
me where to look for the chain&mdash;him not knowin&#8217; it
was a chain&mdash;but somethin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon&#8217;s eyes gleamed with a cold rage&mdash;which
he concealed by passing a hand over his forehead, veiling
his eyes from Harlan. His lips were wreathed in
a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me that the other day&mdash;the
first time I met you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan laughed. &#8220;I was havin&#8217; notions then&mdash;notions
that I&#8217;d be playin&#8217; her a lone hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; Haydon&#8217;s eyes were steady with cold
inquiry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got other notions. I&#8217;m acceptin&#8217; Deveny&#8217;s invitation
to throw in with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon was silent for an instant, and during the
silence his gaze met Harlan&#8217;s fairly. By the humorous
gleam in Harlan&#8217;s eyes Haydon divined that the man
could not be misled&mdash;that he knew something of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
situation in the valley, and that he had come here with
the deliberate intention of joining the outlaw band.
</p>
<p>There was, as Haydon had intimated, little use for
an attempt at equivocation or pretense. It was a situation
that must be faced squarely by both himself and
Harlan. Harlan&#8217;s reputation, and his action in keeping
secret from Barbara Morgan the identity of her
father&#8217;s murderer, indicated sincerity on the man&#8217;s
part. And since Harlan knew him to be the murderer
of Morgan it would be absurd for Haydon to pretend
that he had no connection with Deveny&#8217;s band. He
could not fool this man.
</p>
<p>Yet a jealous hatred of Harlan was thinly concealed
by the steady smile with which he regarded his visitor.
He had felt the antagonism of Harlan that day when
he had talked with him at the bunkhouse door; Harlan&#8217;s
manner that day had convinced him that Harlan
was jealous of his attentions to Barbara Morgan.
Also, there was in his heart a professional jealousy&mdash;jealousy
of Harlan&#8217;s reputation.
</p>
<p>For this man who sat in his chair so calmly, with
danger encompassing him, was greater than he. Haydon
knew it. Had there been any doubt in his mind on
that score it must have been removed by a memory of
the manner in which his men had received the news
that Harlan had left the Rancho Seco and was on his
way up the valley.
</p>
<p>The rider Harlan had seen had come in with that
news&mdash;and Haydon had been standing with the group
at the bunkhouse when the man arrived. And he had
not failed to note the nervous glances of some of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
men, and the restless eagerness, not unmixed with
anxiety, with which they watched the trail.
</p>
<p>And now, facing Harlan, he felt the man&#8217;s greatness&mdash;his
especial fitness for the career he had adopted.
Harlan was the ideal outlaw. He was cool, deep,
subtle. He was indomitable; he felt no fear; his will
was inflexible, adamant. Haydon felt it. The fear he
had experienced at his first meeting with Harlan had
endured until this minute&mdash;it was strong as ever.
</p>
<p>Yet he admired the man; and knew that since he
had come to the valley he must be considered an important
factor. Haydon could not flatly tell him to
get out of the valley; he could not order him away
from the Rancho Seco. Harlan was in control there&mdash;for
the rider who had come in with the news that
Harlan had set out for the valley had also apprised
Haydon of the coming, to the Rancho Seco, of the
men of the T Down outfit.
</p>
<p>The rider had not been able to tell Haydon who
the men were, of course; but it made little difference.
They were friends of Harlan&#8217;s, for they had come
from the direction of the desert&mdash;from Pardo.
</p>
<p>It was plain to Haydon that Harlan had come to
the valley to stay. It was equally plain that he must
be either propitiated or antagonized. He felt that
Harlan was giving him his choice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want&mdash;if you throw in with us?&#8221;
Haydon asked, following the trend of his own
thoughts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s straight talk,&#8221; said Harlan. &#8220;I&#8217;m givin&#8217;
you a straight answer. If I join your bunch I join on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
the same footing with you an&#8217; Deveny&mdash;nothin&#8217; less.
We split everything three ways&mdash;the other boys takin&#8217;
their regular share after we take ours. I bring my boys
in under the rules you&#8217;ve got that govern the others. I
run the Rancho Seco&mdash;no one interferin&#8217;. When I
rustle up that gold old Morgan hid, we split it three
ways. Barbara Morgan goes with the ranch&mdash;no one
interferin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Color surged into Haydon&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want much, do you?&#8221; he sneered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want what&#8217;s comin&#8217; to me&mdash;what I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
take, if I come in. That&#8217;s my proposition. You can
take it or leave it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon was silent for an instant, studying Harlan&#8217;s
face. What he saw there brought a frown to his own.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;some of the boys feel a
little resentful over the way you sent Dolver and Laskar
out. There are several friends of those two men
outside now. Suppose I should call them in and tell
them that the bars are down on you&mdash;eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>If Haydon expected his threat to intimidate Harlan,
he was mistaken. Harlan sat, motionless, watching
the outlaw chief steadily. And into his eyes came a
glitter of that cold contempt which Haydon had seen
in them on the day he had faced Harlan near the
bunkhouse at the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doin&#8217; the honors, Haydon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
you&#8217;re that kind of a coyote I don&#8217;t want to deal with
you. If you think you want to pass up a share of that
hundred thousand, start yappin&#8217; to them boys. It&#8217;s
likely there&#8217;s some of them hangin&#8217; around, close.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
Mebbe you&#8217;ve got some of them peekin&#8217; around corners
at me now. I ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217; from no trouble that
comes my way. Get goin&#8217; if you&#8217;re yearnin&#8217; to requisition
the mourners.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rage over the threat was now plain in his eyes, for
they were aflame with a cold fire as he got up from
his chair and stood, crouching a little, his hands lingering
near the butts of his guns.
</p>
<p>Haydon did not move, but his face grew pallid and
he smiled nervously, with shallow mirth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not in a joking mood today, Harlan?&#8221; he
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s jokes, <i>an&#8217;</i> jokes, Haydon. I&#8217;ve come here
in good faith. I&#8217;ve been in camps like this before&mdash;in
Kelso&#8217;s, Dave Rance&#8217;s, Blondy Larkin&#8217;s, an&#8217; some
others. Them men are outlaws&mdash;like you an&#8217; me; an&#8217;
they&#8217;ve done things that make them greater than you
an&#8217; me&mdash;in our line. But I&#8217;ve visited them, free an&#8217;
easy&mdash;goin&#8217; an&#8217; comin&#8217; whenever I pleased. An&#8217; no
man threatenin&#8217; me.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your manners is irritatin&#8217; to me&mdash;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you
so. I&#8217;m through! You&#8217;re takin&#8217; me out, now&mdash;back
to the Rancho Seco. You&#8217;re ridin&#8217; behind me&mdash;minus
your guns, your mouth shut tighter than you ever shut
it before. An&#8217; if there&#8217;s any shootin&#8217; you&#8217;ll know it&mdash;plenty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan had brought matters to a crisis&mdash;suddenly,
in a flash. The time for pretense had gone. Haydon
could accept Harlan upon the terms he had mentioned,
or he could take up the man&#8217;s challenge with all it implied&mdash;bitter
warfare between the two factions, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
would be unprofitable to both, and especially to Haydon.
</p>
<p>It was for Haydon to decide; and he sat for some
seconds motionless in the chair, before he spoke.
</p>
<p>Then he got up&mdash;taking care to keep his right hand
at a respectable distance from the butt of his pistol,
and smilingly held out his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It goes your way, Harlan&mdash;we take you in on
your terms. I beg your pardon for saying what I did.
That was just to try you out. I&#8217;ve heard a lot about
you, and I wanted to see if you were in earnest&mdash;if
you really wanted to come in. I&#8217;m satisfied.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They shook hands; their gaze meeting as they stood
close together. The gaze endured for an instant; and
then Haydon&#8217;s fell. The handshake lasted for several
seconds, and it was curious to see how Haydon&#8217;s eyes,
after they had become veiled from Harlan&#8217;s by the
drooping lids, glowed with a malignant triumph and
cunning.
</p>
<p>It was also curious to note that something of the
same passion was revealed in Harlan&#8217;s eyes as they
rested on the partially closed lids of the other&mdash;for
there was triumph there, too&mdash;and comprehension,
and craft of a kind that might have disturbed Haydon,
had he seen it.
</p>
<p>Then their hands parted, mutually, and Haydon
grinned smoothly and with apparent cordiality at Harlan.
He grasped Harlan by an elbow and urged him
toward the door through which the latter had entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a knockdown to the boys, now&mdash;those
that are here,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>An hour later&mdash;after Haydon and the dozen men
to whom he had introduced Harlan had watched Harlan
ride eastward through the valley toward the Rancho
Seco&mdash;Haydon rode westward, accompanied by
several of the men.
</p>
<p>They rode for many miles into the heart of the big
basin, coming at last to a gorge that wound a serpentine
way southward, through some concealing hills,
into a smaller basin. A heavy timber clump grew at
the mouth of the gorge, hiding it from view from the
trail that ran through the valley. Some rank underbrush
that fringed the timber gave the mouth of the
gorge the appearance of a shallow cave, and a wall of
rock, forming a ragged arch over the entrance,
heightened the impression. At first glance the place
seemed to be impenetrable.
</p>
<p>But the horsemen filed through easily enough, and
the underbrush closed behind them, so that, had they
been seen, the watcher might have been startled by
their sudden disappearance.
</p>
<p>Near the center of the little basin stood a huge
cabin, built of adobe, with a flat roof. In a small
corral were a number of cattle. Grazing upon the
grass, with which the place was carpeted, were many
horses; and lounging in the grass near the cabin, and
upon some benches that ranged its walls, were perhaps
a dozen men, heavily armed.
</p>
<p>Several of the men grinned as the newcomers rode
in and dismounted, and one or two spoke a short greeting
to Haydon, calling him &#8220;Chief.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon did not linger to talk with the men, though;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
he dismounted and entered the cabin, where, an instant
later, he was talking with Deveny.
</p>
<p>Haydon&#8217;s eyes were still triumphant&mdash;glowing with
a malignant satisfaction.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s wise&mdash;and dead tickled to join,&#8221; he told
Deveny, referring to Harlan. &#8220;And I took him in on
his own terms. We&#8217;ll play him along, making him
believe he&#8217;s regular and right, until we get what we
want. Then we&#8217;ll down him!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>At about the time Haydon was talking with Deveny,
Harlan was dismounting at the Rancho Seco corral.
</p>
<p>The T Down men were variously engaged&mdash;some
of them in the corral; others in the stable, and still
others in the blacksmith-shop&mdash;all attending to their
new duties&mdash;and only Red Linton was at the corral
gate to greet Harlan.
</p>
<p>Triumph was in Harlan&#8217;s eyes as he grinned at Linton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Simon-pure outlaw now, Red,&#8221; he stated.
&#8220;Haydon didn&#8217;t hesitate none. He&#8217;s a sneakin&#8217;,
schemin&#8217; devil, an&#8217; he hates me like poison. But he
took me in, reckonin&#8217; to play me for a sucker. Looks
like things might be interestin&#8217;.&#8221; He grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;m
yearnin&#8217; for grub, Red.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Later, while Harlan was seated at a table in the
cook shanty, he became aware of a shadow at the
door; and he wheeled, to see Barbara Morgan looking
in at him, her face flushed, a glow in her eyes that was
entirely comprehensible to Harlan.
</p>
<p>She was glad he had returned&mdash;any man with half
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
Harlan&#8217;s wisdom could have told that! And color of
a kind not caused by the wind and sun suffused Harlan&#8217;s
face.
</p>
<p>She had seen him from one of the kitchen windows,
and curiosity&mdash;and an impatience that would not permit
of delay&mdash;had brought her to search for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&mdash;I thought&mdash;didn&#8217;t you say
that you were going away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I go?&#8221; he grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;For a day,&#8221; she taunted, her voice leaping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A day,&#8221; he said gravely; &#8220;why, it was longer than
that, wasn&#8217;t it? Seems that I ain&#8217;t seen you for years
an&#8217; years!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He got up, his hunger forgotten. But when he
reached the door he saw her running toward the ranchhouse,
not even looking back. He stood watching her
until she opened a door and vanished. Then he
grinned and returned to his neglected food, saying
aloud, after the manner of men who spend much time
in open places: &#8220;I&#8217;ll sure take care of her, Morgan.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>LEFT-HANDED</h3>
</div>

<p>Harlan&#8217;s statement to Haydon, to the effect
that he had visited the camps of Kelso, Rance,
Larkin, and other outlaws had been strictly accurate.
At one time or another each of those outlaw leaders
had sent for Harlan, to endeavor to prevail upon him
to cast his lot with them&mdash;so common was the report
that Harlan was of their type.
</p>
<p>And he had been able&mdash;as he had told Haydon&mdash;to
go among them with impunity&mdash;unmolested, respected.
And even after he had refused to join they
had extended him the courtesy of faith&mdash;not even
swearing him to secrecy. And he had vindicated their
faith by keeping silent regarding them.
</p>
<p>Knowing, however, that the ethics of men of the
type of Kelso, Rance, Larkin, and others provided a
safe conduct for any man of their kind that came
among them, Harlan had felt contempt for Haydon
for his threat. And yet Harlan&#8217;s rage on that occasion
had been largely surface; it had been displayed for
effect&mdash;to force an instant decision from Haydon.
</p>
<p>Harlan was aware that his only hope of protecting
Barbara Morgan from Haydon and Deveny was in an
offensive war. He could not expect to wage such a
war by remaining idly at the Rancho Seco, to await the
inevitable aggressions of the outlaws, for he did not
know when they would strike, nor how. It was certain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
they would strike, and it was as certain they would
strike when he least expected them to.
</p>
<p>Therefore he had determined to join them, depending
upon his reputation to allay any suspicion they
might have regarding his motives. Haydon had taken
him into the band, but Harlan had been convinced that
Haydon distrusted him. He had seen distrust in Haydon&#8217;s
eyes; and he had known, when Haydon dropped
his gaze at the instant they had shaken hands, that the
man meditated duplicity.
</p>
<p>Yet Harlan was determined to appear ignorant that
Haydon meditated trickery. He intended to go among
the men and deliberately to ignore the threatened dangers&mdash;more,
to conduct himself in such a manner that
Haydon would not suspect that he knew of any danger.
</p>
<p>It had been a slight incident that had suggested the
plan to him&mdash;merely a glance at Strom Rogers, while
the latter, in Lamo, had been watching Deveny.
</p>
<p>Harlan had seen hatred in Rogers&#8217; face, and contempt
and jealousy; and he knew that where such passion
existed it could be made to grow and flourish by
suggestion and by example.
</p>
<p>And he was determined to furnish the example.
</p>
<p>He knew something of the passions of men of the
type which constituted the band headed by Deveny and
Haydon; he knew how their passions might be played
upon; he was aware of their respect and admiration
for men of notorious reputation, with records for evil
deeds and rapid &#8220;gunslinging.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had seen how Strom Rogers had watched him&mdash;with
awed respect; he had seen approval in Rogers&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
eyes when they had exchanged glances in Lamo; and
he had heard men in the group in front of the sheriff&#8217;s
office speaking of him in awed whispers.
</p>
<p>He had never been affected by that sort of adulation&mdash;in
Lamo or in the days that preceded his visit
to the town. But he was not unmindful of the advantage
such adulation would give him in his campaign
for control of the outlaw camp. And that was what
he had determined to achieve.
</p>
<p>Three times in as many days he rode up the valley
to the Star, each time talking with Haydon&mdash;then
leaving the latter to go out and lounge around among
the men, listening to their talk, but taking little part in
it. He did not speak until he was spoken to, and thus
he challenged their interest, and they began to make
advances to him.
</p>
<p>Their social structure was flimsy and thin, their fellowship
as spontaneous as it was insincere; and within
a few days the edge had worn off the strangeness that
had surrounded Harlan, and he had been accepted
with hardly a ripple of excitement.
</p>
<p>And yet no man among them had achieved intimacy
with Harlan. There was a cold constraint in his manner
that held them off, figuratively, barring them from
becoming familiar with him. Several of them tried
familiarity, and were astonished to discover that they
had somehow failed&mdash;though they had been repelled
so cleverly that they could not resent it.
</p>
<p>Harlan had established a barrier without them
being aware of how he had done it&mdash;the barrier of
authority and respect, behind which he stood, an engaging,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
saturnine, interesting, awe-compelling figure.
</p>
<p>At the end of a week the men of the Star outfit
were addressing him as &#8220;boss;&#8221; listening to him with
respect when he spoke, striving for his attention, and
trying to win from him one of those rare smiles with
which he honored those among them whose personalities
interested him.
</p>
<p>At the end of two weeks half of the Star outfit was
eager to obey any order he issued, while the remainder
betrayed some slight hesitation&mdash;which, however,
vanished when Harlan turned his steady gaze upon
them.
</p>
<p>Behind their acceptance of him, though&mdash;back of
their seeming willingness to admit him to their peculiar
fellowship&mdash;was a reservation. Harlan felt it, saw
it in their eyes, and noted it in their manner toward
him. They had heard about him; they knew something
of his record; reports of his cleverness with a
weapon had come to them. And they were curious.
</p>
<p>There was speculation in the glances they threw at
him; there was some suspicion, cynicism, skepticism,
and not a little doubt. It seemed to Harlan that
though they had accepted him they were impatiently
awaiting a practical demonstration of those qualities
that had made him famous in the country. They
wanted to be &#8220;shown.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Their wild, unruly passions and lurid imaginations
were the urges that drove them&mdash;that shaped their
conduct toward their fellows. Some of them were
rapid gunslingers&mdash;in the picturesque idioms of their
speech&mdash;and there was not a man among them who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
did not take pride in his ability to &#8220;work&#8221; his gun.
They had accepted Harlan, but it was obvious that
among them were some that doubted the veracity of
rumor&mdash;some who felt that Harlan had been overrated.
</p>
<p>It did not take Harlan long to discover who those
doubting spirits were. He saw them watching him&mdash;always
with curling lip and truculent eye; he heard
references to his ability from them&mdash;scraps of conversation
in which such terms and phrases as &#8220;a false
alarm, mebbe,&#8221; &#8220;he don&#8217;t look it,&#8221; &#8220;wears &#8217;em for
show, I reckon,&#8221; were used. He had learned the
names of the men; there were three of them, known
merely as &#8220;Lanky,&#8221; &#8220;Poggs,&#8221; and &#8220;Latimer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Their raids upon the cattle in the basin took place
at night; and their other depredations occurred at that
time also. Harlan did not fail to hear of them, for
their successes figured prominently in their daytime
conversations; and he had watched the herd of cattle
in the Star corrals grow in size until the enclosure
grew too small to hold them comfortably. He had
noted, too, the cleverness with which the men obliterated
the brands on the stolen cattle&mdash;or refashioned
them until proof of their identity was obscure.
</p>
<p>He had taken no part in any of the raids, though
he had passed a few nights at the Star, directing, with
the help of Strom Rogers, the altering of the brands
and the other work attending the disguising of the
cattle.
</p>
<p>Haydon he had seen but a few times, and Deveny
not at all. He learned from Rogers that Haydon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
spent most of his time upon mysterious missions which
took him to Lamo, to Lazette, and to Las Vegas; and
that Deveny operated from a place that Rogers referred
to as the &#8220;Cache,&#8221; several miles up the valley.
</p>
<p>Latimer, a tawny giant of a man with a long,
hooked nose, and thin, cruel lips, interested Harlan.
He watched the man when the other was not conscious
of his glances, noting the bigness of him, his slow,
panther-like movements; the glowing, savage truculence
of his eyes; the hard, bitter droop of his lips
under the yellow mustache he wore. He felt the threat
of the man when the latter looked at him&mdash;it was personal,
intense&mdash;seeming to have motive behind it. It
aroused in Harlan a responsive passion.
</p>
<p>One day, seated on a bench in front of the long
bunkhouse near the Star ranchhouse, Harlan was
watching some of the men who were playing cards
near him. They were lounging in the grass, laughingly
pitting their skill against one another, while another
group, in front of the stable, was diligently repairing
saddles.
</p>
<p>Apart from the two groups were Lanky, Poggs, and
Latimer. They were standing near the corral fence,
about a hundred feet from where Harlan sat. The
subject of their talk was unpleasant, for their faces
reflected the venomous passions that inspired it.
</p>
<p>Latimer had been watching Harlan&mdash;his gaze
boldly hostile and full of a hate that was unmistakable.
</p>
<p>And Harlan had not been unaware of Latimer&#8217;s
gaze; he had noted the wolfish gleam in the other&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
eyes&mdash;and because he was interested in Latimer, he
watched him covertly.
</p>
<p>But Harlan had betrayed no sign that he knew Latimer
was watching him; and when he saw Strom Rogers
coming toward him from the stable, he grinned at him
and made room for him when the latter headed for
the bench upon which Harlan was sitting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lazy day,&#8221; offered Rogers as he dropped on the
bench beside Harlan; &#8220;not a heap doin&#8217;.&#8221; He did
not look at Harlan, but leaned forward, took up a
cinch buckle that had been lying in the sand at his feet,
and turned it idly over and over in his hands, apparently
intent on its construction.
</p>
<p>With his head down, so that even the card-players
could not see his lips move, he whispered to Harlan:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em see you know I&#8217;m talkin&#8217;! They&#8217;re
framin&#8217; up on you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned, shielding his lips with a hand that
he passed casually over them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanin&#8217; Latimer&mdash;an&#8217; his friends?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Latimer&#8217;s jealous of you. Been jealous.
Thinks he can match your gunplay&mdash;itchin&#8217; for
trouble&mdash;bound to have it out with you. We was at
the Cache last night, an&#8217; I heard him an&#8217; Deveny
yappin&#8217; about it. Deveny&#8217;s back of him&mdash;he&#8217;s sore
about the way you handed it to him in Lamo. Keep
your eyes peeled; they&#8217;re pullin&#8217; it off pretty soon.
Latimer&#8217;s doin&#8217; the shootin&#8217;&mdash;he&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to work himself
up to it. Be careful.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thankin&#8217; you.&#8221; Harlan leaned back, crossed
his legs, and stared off into space, the light in his eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
becoming vacuous. He seemed not to be interested
in Latimer and the other two, but in reality he saw
them distinctly. But they had their backs to him now,
and were slowly sauntering toward the stable door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So Deveny ain&#8217;t admirin&#8217; me none?&#8221; he said to
Rogers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not scarcely. No more than a gopher is admirin&#8217;
a side-winder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Latimer,&#8221; said Harlan, &#8220;don&#8217;t like my style of
beauty either. I&#8217;ve been noticin&#8217; it. He&#8217;s a mighty interestin&#8217;
man. If I wasn&#8217;t dead sure he ain&#8217;t the kind
of a guy which goes around shootin&#8217; folks in the back,
I&#8217;d say he pretty near fits the description I got of the
man who helped Dolver salivate my side-kicker, Davey
Langan, over in Pardo&mdash;a couple of months ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rogers&#8217; side glance was pregnant with a grim, unsmiling
humor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve picked him out? I&#8217;ve been wonderin&#8217;
how long it would take you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The emotion that passed over Harlan was not visible.
It might have been detected, however, by the
slight leap in his voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You an&#8217; Latimer is bosom friends, I reckon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rogers&#8217; glance met Harlan&#8217;s for a fleeting instant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This gang needs cleanin&#8217; up,&#8221; said Rogers. He
got up, and stood in front of Harlan, holding out the
cinch buckle, as though offering it to the other. For
both men had seen that Latimer had left his friends at
the stable door and was coming slowly toward the
bunkhouse.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be slick,&#8221; warned Rogers. &#8220;He&#8217;s
comin&#8217;. I&#8217;ll be moseyin&#8217; out of the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He moved slowly from the bench, passed the group
of card-players, and walked to the ranchhouse, where
he hung the cinch buckle on a nail driven into the wall
of the building. Then he slowly turned, facing the
bench upon which Harlan still sat, and toward which
Latimer was walking.
</p>
<p>It was evident that all of the men in the vicinity
were aware of the threatened clash, for their manner,
upon the approach of Latimer, indicated as much.
</p>
<p>For weeks they had been eager to test the traditional
quickness of Harlan with the weapons that
swung at his hips&mdash;those weapons had been a constant
irritation to some of them, and an object of speculation
to all. And when the night before some of them
had heard the whispered word that Latimer&mdash;with
Deveny&#8217;s sanction&mdash;indeed with Deveny&#8217;s encouragement&mdash;was
determined to clash with Harlan, they
had realized that the moment for which they had
yearned was at hand.
</p>
<p>For they had seen in Harlan&#8217;s eyes&mdash;and had felt
in the atmosphere that surrounded the man&mdash;the certainty
that he would not refuse the clash with Latimer.
The only question in their minds concerning Harlan
was that of his speed and accuracy. And so when they
saw Latimer coming they ceased playing cards and sat,
interestedly watching&mdash;alert to note how Latimer
would bring about the clash, and how Harlan would
meet it.
</p>
<p>Latimer had nerved himself for the ordeal by talking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
with his friends. The will to kill Harlan had been
in his heart for a long time, but he needed to reinforce
it with an artificial rage. And, dwelling, with his
friends, upon the irritating fact that Harlan had come
among them to usurp authority to which he had no
visible claim, he had succeeded in working his rage to a
frenzy that took little account of consequences.
</p>
<p>Yet Latimer would not have been able to reach that
frenzy had he not been convinced that he was Harlan&#8217;s
master with the six-shooter. He really believed that
Harlan had been overrated. He believed that because
he wanted to believe it, and because his contempt for
the man had bred that conviction in his heart.
</p>
<p>Also, he thought he knew why Harlan had come to
the Star&mdash;why he had joined the outlaw camp. And
the night before, he had communicated that suspicion
to Deveny. It was because Harlan knew he had been
with Dolver when Davey Langan had been killed.
Latimer thought he had seen a slight relief in Deveny&#8217;s
eyes when he had told the latter that, but he
could not be sure, and it was not important.
</p>
<p>The important thing was that he must kill Harlan&mdash;and
he meant to do it. He would kill him fairly, if
possible, thereby enhancing his reputation&mdash;but he
was certain to kill him, no matter what the method.
</p>
<p>That conviction blazed in his eyes as he came to a
halt within a dozen paces of where Harlan was sitting.
He had worked himself to such a pitch of rage that it
gripped him like some strong fever&mdash;bloating his
face, tensing his muscles, bulging his eyes.
</p>
<p>Harlan had watched him; and his gaze was on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
other now with a steady, unwavering alertness that
advertised his knowledge of what was impending. But
he sat, motionless, rigid, waiting Latimer&#8217;s first hostile
movement.
</p>
<p>Harlan had turned a very little when Latimer had
begun his walk toward the bench; his right side was
slightly toward the man, the leg partially extended;
while the left leg was doubled under the bench&mdash;seemingly
to give him leverage should he decide to
rise.
</p>
<p>But he gave no indication of meditating such a
move. It was plain to the watchers that if he attempted
it Latimer would draw his gun and begin to
shoot.
</p>
<p>Latimer was convinced also that Harlan would not
attempt to rise. He had Harlan at a disadvantage,
and he laughed loudly, sardonically, contemptuously
as he stood, his right hand hovering close to his pistol
holster, his eyes aflame with hate and passion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a-settin&#8217;, you buzzard&#8217;s whelp!&#8221; he sneered;
&#8220;keep a-settin&#8217;! Latimer&#8217;s out to git you. You know
it&mdash;eh? You&#8217;ve knowed it right along&mdash;pretendin&#8217;
not to. &#8216;Drag&#8217; Harlan&mdash;bah! Gunslinger with a
record&mdash;an&#8217; caught a-settin&#8217;. Caught with the goods
on, sneakin&#8217; in here, tryin&#8217; to ketch a man unawares.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! Don&#8217;t I know what you&#8217;re here for? It&#8217;s
me! You blowed Dolver apart for killin&#8217; that damned,
slick-eyed pardner of yourn&mdash;Davey Langan. Do
you want to know who sent Langan out? I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
you&mdash;it was me! Me&mdash;me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He fairly yelled the last words, and stiffened, holding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the fingers of his right hand clawlike, above the
butt of the holstered pistol.
</p>
<p>And when he saw that Harlan did not move; that
he sat there rigid, his eyes unblinking and expressionless;
his right hand hanging limply at his side, near the
partially extended leg; his left hand resting upon the
thigh of the doubled leg&mdash;he stepped closer, watching
Harlan&#8217;s right hand.
</p>
<p>For a space&mdash;while one might have counted ten&mdash;neither
man moved a muscle. Something in Harlan&#8217;s
manner sent into Latimer&#8217;s frenzied brain the message
that all was not what it seemed&mdash;that Harlan was
meditating some astonishing action. Ten seconds is
not long, as times goes, but during that slight interval
the taut nerves of Latimer&#8217;s were twanged with a torturing
doubt that began to creep over him.
</p>
<p>Would Harlan never make that move? That question
was dinned insistently into Latimer&#8217;s ears. He
began to believe that Harlan did not intend to draw.
</p>
<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Latimer&#8217;s lungs that breathed the ejaculation.
</p>
<p>For Harlan&#8217;s right hand had moved slightly upward,
toward the pistol at his right hip. It went only
a few inches; it was still far below the holster when
Latimer&#8217;s clawlike fingers descended to the butt of his
own weapon. The thought that he would beat Harlan
in a fair draw was in his mind&mdash;that he would
beat him despite the confusion of the hesitating motion
with which Harlan got his gun out.
</p>
<p>Something was happening, though&mdash;something odd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
and unexplainable. For though Latimer had seemed
to have plenty of time, he was conscious that Harlan&#8217;s
gun was belching fire and death at him. He saw the
smoke streaks, felt the bullets striking him, searing
their way through him, choking him, weakening his
knees.
</p>
<p>He went down, his eyes wide with incredulity, filling
with hideous self-derision when he saw that the pistol
which had sent his death to him was not in Harlan&#8217;s
right hand at all, but in his left.
</p>
<p>Harlan got up slowly as Latimer stretched out in
the dust at his feet&mdash;casting one swift glance at the
fallen man to satisfy himself that for <i>him</i> the incident
was ended. Then, with the gaze of every man in the
outfit upon him, he strode toward the stable, where
Lanky and Poggs were standing, having witnessed the
death of their confederate.
</p>
<p>They stiffened to immobility as they watched Harlan&#8217;s
approach, knowing that for them the incident was
not closed&mdash;their guilt plain in their faces.
</p>
<p>And when Harlan halted in front of them they
stood, not moving a muscle, their eyes searching Harlan&#8217;s
face for signs that they too, were to receive a
demonstration of the man&#8217;s uncanny cleverness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You was backin&#8217; Latimer&#8217;s play,&#8221; said Harlan,
shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m aimin&#8217; to play the string out. Pull&mdash;or
I&#8217;ll blow you apart!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Poggs and Lanky did not &#8220;pull.&#8221; They stood
there, ghastly color stealing into their faces, their eyes
wide with the knowledge that death would be the penalty
of a hostile movement.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s pistol was again in its holster, and yet they
had no desire to provoke the man to draw it. The
furtive gleam in the eyes of both revealed the hope
that gripped them&mdash;that some of the watchers would
interfere.
</p>
<p>But not a man moved. Most of them had been
stunned by the rapidity of Harlan&#8217;s action&mdash;by the
deftness with which he had brought his left hand into
use. They had received the practical demonstration
for which they all had longed, and each man&#8217;s manner
plainly revealed his decision to take no part in what
was transpiring.
</p>
<p>They remained in their places while Harlan&mdash;understanding
that Poggs and Lanky would not accept
his invitation&mdash;spoke gruffly to them:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This camp ain&#8217;t got any room for skunks that go
to framin&#8217; up on any of the boys. Today you done it
to me&mdash;tomorrow you&#8217;d try to pull it off on some
other guy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re travelin&#8217;&mdash;pronto. You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; your
cayuses. Then you&#8217;re hittin&#8217; the breeze away from
here&mdash;an&#8217; not comin&#8217; back. That lets you out.
Mosey!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood watchful, alert, while the men roped their
horses, got their &#8220;war-bags,&#8221; from the bunkhouse,
mounted, and rode away without looking back. Then
he walked over to the bench where he had been sitting
when Rogers had warned him of the plan to kill him;
ordered several of the men to take Latimer&#8217;s body
away, and then resumed his place on the bench, where
he rolled a cigarette.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>Later, when the men who had gone with Latimer&#8217;s
body returned to the vicinity of the ranchhouse, Harlan
was still sitting on the bench.
</p>
<p>No man said a word to him, but he saw a new respect
in the eyes of all of them&mdash;even in Rogers&#8217; gaze&mdash;which
had not strayed from him for an instant during
the trouble.
</p>
<p>And a little later, when Rogers walked to the bench
and sat beside him, the other men had resumed their
various pastimes as though nothing had happened.
</p>
<p>Again Rogers whispered to him, lowly, admiringly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;This camp is yours, man, whenever you say the
word!&#8221;
</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE BLACK-BEARDED MAN</h3>
</div>

<p>It was Strom Rogers who indicated to the outlaws
at the Star that henceforth Harlan was to exercise
authority of a kind that had formerly been vested in
Haydon and Deveny.
</p>
<p>The corral was packed to suffocation with cattle,
threatening the health of the animals; Deveny had
sent no word from the Cache regarding the disposal
of the stock, and Haydon&#8217;s whereabouts were unknown.
</p>
<p>Rogers had moved stock on his own initiative in
former days&mdash;for he had been an able assistant to
both leaders. And Rogers could have moved the stock
out of the corral and to the point far south where the
outlaws had always sold them.
</p>
<p>But there was malice in Rogers&#8217; heart toward the
two outlaw leaders, and a perverse devil lurked in
him. For many months he had worshiped Barbara
Morgan from a distance, vaguely aware that his passion
for her could never be realized. But there was
a spark of honesty and justice in Rogers despite his
profession, and a sincere admiration for the girl that
admitted of no thought of evil toward her.
</p>
<p>He had almost betrayed his resentment to Deveny
when in Lamo, on the day of the coming of Harlan,
Deveny had boldly announced his intentions toward
the girl; and it had been a dread of clashing with Deveny
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
that had kept him from interfering. The will to
protect the girl had been in Rogers&#8217; mind, but he
lacked the physical courage to risk his life for her.
</p>
<p>This man who had boldly entered the outlaw camp,
after first defying Deveny in Lamo, had made a stirring
appeal to the good in Rogers; and he foresaw
that trouble, in which Harlan had a chance to emerge
victorious, was certain. And he had decided to align
himself with the Pardo gunman.
</p>
<p>Therefore, on this morning, when it was certain
that the cattle in the corral must be moved, he deliberately
refused to exercise his prerogative. Instead, he
waited until after breakfast&mdash;when the men were congregated
outside the bunkhouse door&mdash;when he was
certain they would all hear him.
</p>
<p>Harlan had come out, too. He had not visited the
Rancho Seco for more than a week, fearing that his
absence might jeopardize the advantage he had gained
over the men through the killing of Latimer.
</p>
<p>With the attention of all the men centered upon
him, Rogers walked close to Harlan, speaking loudly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Them cattle ought to hit the trail, Harlan. It&#8217;s
up to you&mdash;you&#8217;re the boss. Do we move &#8217;em&mdash;an&#8217;
where?&#8221;
</p>
<p>A comprehensive light gleamed in Harlan&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They move,&#8221; he said shortly. &#8220;Drive them where
you&#8217;ve been drivin&#8217; them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As though he had been giving orders to the outlaws
all his life, he briskly mentioned the names of the men
who were to form the trail herd.
</p>
<p>Not a man dissented. Those whose names were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
called quickly detached themselves from the group,
and sought the horse corral; where they roped their
horses and began to make preparations to obey Harlan&#8217;s
order. And later, when the cattle were driven
out of the corral, and the trail herd crew straggled behind
them over the level that led southward, the men
were grinning.
</p>
<p>For Harlan had told them that their share of the
spoils resulting from the sale of the cattle was to be
materially increased. He had likewise told them that
they might spend an extra day in &#8220;town&#8221; before their
return.
</p>
<p>Only one man besides Harlan remained at the Star
after the herd vanished into the southern distance.
That man was the black-bearded fellow who had escorted
Harlan to the ranchhouse on the occasion of his
first visit&mdash;Lafe Woodward.
</p>
<p>This man&#8217;s admiration for Harlan had never been
concealed. He had stayed as close to Harlan as possible;
and from his manner Harlan had divined that
the man was eager to ingratiate himself.
</p>
<p>Woodward stood near Harlan as the herd and the
men vanished. He had grinned widely when, just
before the outfit had departed, he had heard Rogers
whisper to Harlan:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made yourself solid with the bunch, for
sure, by offerin&#8217; &#8217;em a bigger divvy. They&#8217;ve been
grumblin&#8217; about it for a long time. They&#8217;re all sore
at Haydon an&#8217; Deveny for bein&#8217; greedy. But you&#8217;re
sure cookin&#8217; up a heap of trouble with Haydon an&#8217;
Deveny!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Harlan grinned with grim mirthlessness. It had
been his first opportunity to stir up dissension and
strife in the outlaw camp, and he had taken instant advantage
of it. He had created factional feeling, and
he was prepared to accept the consequences.
</p>
<p>And, later in the day, when he saw Haydon ride in,
dismount and cast a surprised glance at the empty
corral, he knew that the moment for which he had
planned, had come.
</p>
<p>Woodward was nowhere in sight; and Harlan, who
had been in the blacksmith-shop, made himself visible
to Haydon by stepping outside.
</p>
<p>Haydon called to him, sharply; and Harlan walked
slowly to where the outlaw chief stood, a saturnine
grin on his face, his eyes alight with a cold humor that
might have been illuminating to Haydon had he taken
the trouble to look into them.
</p>
<p>Haydon was laboring under some strong passion.
He was suppressing it with an effort, but it showed in
his tensed muscles and in his flushed face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the cattle?&#8221; he demanded, his voice
a trifle hoarse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re headed for Willow Wells&mdash;where you&#8217;ve
been sellin&#8217; them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By whose orders?&#8221; Haydon&#8217;s voice was choked
with passion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine,&#8221; drawled Harlan. Harlan might have explained
that the stock had been suffering in the crowded
enclosure, thus assuaging Haydon&#8217;s wrath. But he
gave no explanation&mdash;that would have been a revelation
of eagerness to escape blame and the possible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
consequences of his act. Instead of explaining he
looked steadily into Haydon&#8217;s eyes, his own cold and
unblinking.
</p>
<p>He saw Haydon&#8217;s wrath flare up&mdash;it was in the
heightened color that spread upward above the collar
of his shirt; he saw the man&#8217;s terrific effort at self-control;
and his look grew bitter with insolence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s botherin&#8217; you?&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cattle&mdash;damn it!&#8221; shouted Haydon. &#8220;What
in hell do you mean by sending them away without
orders?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m havin&#8217; my say, Haydon. We agreed to split
everything three ways. Authority to give orders goes
with that. That was the agreement. A man&#8217;s got
to be either a captain or a private, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve never
played second to any man. I ain&#8217;t beginnin&#8217; now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, damn you!&#8221; gasped Haydon. His eyes
were aglare with a terrible rage and hate; he stepped
backward a little, bending his right arm, spreading the
fingers.
</p>
<p>Harlan had made no move, but the light in his eyes
betrayed his complete readiness for the trouble that
Haydon plainly meditated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, slowly, drawling his words, a little!
&#8220;It&#8217;s come to that, I reckon. You&#8217;ve got to flash your
gun now, or take it back. No man cusses me an&#8217; gets
away with it. Get goin&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon stood, swaying from side to side, in the
grip of a mighty indecision. The fingers of his right
hand spread wider; the hand descended to a point
nearer to his pistol holster.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>There it poised, the fingers hooked, like the talons
of some giant bird about to clutch a victim.
</p>
<p>Had Haydon faced a man with less courage; had
Harlan&#8217;s iron control lacked that quality which permitted
him to give an enemy that small chance for life
which he always gave them, death might have reigned
at the Star again. Haydon owed his life to that hesitation
which had made Harlan famous.
</p>
<p>And as the strained, tense seconds passed with both
men holding the positions they had assumed, it seemed
Haydon was slowly beginning to realize that Harlan
was reluctant, was deliberately giving him a chance.
</p>
<p>A change came over Haydon. The clawlike fingers
began to straighten; imperceptibly at first, and then
with a spasmodic motion that flexed the muscles in
little jerks. The hand became limp; it dropped slowly
to his side&mdash;down beyond the pistol holster. Then it
came up, and the man swept it over his eyes, as though
to brush away a vision that frightened him.
</p>
<p>His face grew pale, he shuddered; and at last he
stood, swaying a little, his mouth open with wonder
for the phenomenal thing that had happened to him.
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s voice, cold and expressionless, startled
him:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wasn&#8217;t meanin&#8217; to cuss me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; The denial was blurted forth. Haydon
grinned, faintly, with hideous embarrassment; the
knowledge that he had been beaten, and that he owed
his life to Harlan, was plain in his eyes.
</p>
<p>He laughed, uncertainly, as he made an effort to
stiffen his lagging muscles.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was a bit flustered, Harlan; I talked rather recklessly,
I admit. You see, I&#8217;ve been used to giving orders
myself. I was riled for a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That goes!&#8221; said Harlan, shortly. His voice had
changed. The slow drawl had gone, and a snapping,
authoritative sharpness had replaced it.
</p>
<p>Haydon gazed at him with a new wonder. He
sensed in Harlan&#8217;s manner the consciousness of power,
the determination to command. At a stroke, it seemed,
Harlan had wrenched from him the right to rule. He
felt himself being relegated to a subordinate position;
he felt at this minute the ruthless force of the man who
stood before him; he felt oddly impotent and helpless,
and he listened to Harlan with a queer feeling of wonder
for the absence of the rage that should have
gripped him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m runnin&#8217; things from now on,&#8221; Harlan said.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t interferin&#8217; with the Star. But I&#8217;m runnin&#8217;
things for the boys. I told Rogers to drive the cattle
to Willow&#8217;s Wells&mdash;an&#8217; to sell them. I&#8217;ve promised
the boys a bigger divvy. They get it. I&#8217;ve told them
to take a day off, in town, after they turn the cattle
over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s got to be a new deal. The boys are fussed
up&mdash;claimin&#8217; they ain&#8217;t gettin&#8217; their share. I&#8217;m seein&#8217;
that they do. You can&#8217;t run a camp like this an&#8217; not
treat the boys right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wonder that had been aroused in Haydon grew
as Harlan talked; it increased in intensity until, when
Harlan&#8217;s voice died away, it developed into suspicion.
</p>
<p>That was what Harlan had come to the Star for!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
He wanted to run the camp, to direct the activities of
the outlaws in the valley. Power! Authority! Those
were the things Harlan craved for.
</p>
<p>Haydon saw it all, now. He saw that Harlan
wanted to dominate&mdash;everything. He wanted to rule
the outlaw camp; he wanted to run the Rancho Seco;
he intended to get possession of the gold that Morgan
had left, and he wanted Barbara Morgan.
</p>
<p>The rage that had held Haydon in its clutch when
he had called Harlan to him was reviving. Haydon&#8217;s
face was still white, but the fury in his eyes&mdash;slowly
growing&mdash;was not to be mistaken.
</p>
<p>Harlan saw it, and his lips straightened. He had
expected Haydon would rage over what he had determined
to tell him; and he was not surprised. He had
deliberately goaded the man into his present fury. He
had determined to kill him, and he had been disappointed
when he had seen Haydon lose his courage
when the crisis arrived. And now his deliberate and
premeditated plan was to bear fruit.
</p>
<p>Harlan was reluctant to kill, but there seemed to be
no other way. Haydon was a murderer. He had
killed Lane Morgan; he was an outlaw whose rule had
oppressed the valley for many months. If Harlan
could have devised some plan that would make it possible
for him to attain his end without killing anybody,
he would have eagerly adopted it.
</p>
<p>But in this country force must be fought with force.
It was a grim game, and the rules were inflexible&mdash;kill
or be killed.
</p>
<p>His own life would be safe in this section so long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
as he guarded it. Eternal vigilance and the will to
take life when his own was threatened was a principle
which custom had established. If he expected to save
the girl at the Rancho Seco he could not temper his
actions with mercy. And he knew that if he was to
succeed in his design to disrupt the outlaw gang he
would have to remove the man who stood before him,
working himself into a new frenzy. There seemed to
be no other way.
</p>
<p>But Haydon seemed to have control of himself,
now, despite the frenzied glare of his eyes. He was
outwardly cool; his movements were deliberate&mdash;he
had conquered his fear of Harlan, it seemed.
</p>
<p>He laughed, harshly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you had me going&mdash;talking
that way. By Heaven! you almost convinced me that
I&#8217;d <i>let</i> you run things here. I was beginning to believe
I&#8217;d lost my nerve. But see here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He held out his right hand toward Harlan&mdash;it was
steady, rigid, not a nerve in it quivered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fast with your guns, but you can&#8217;t run any
whizzer in on me&mdash;you can&#8217;t intimidate me. You
killed Latimer the other day; and you&#8217;ve got the boys
with you. But you can&#8217;t run things here. Have all
the boys gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woodward&#8217;s here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan spoke lowly; his eyes were keenly watchful.
This flare-up on Haydon&#8217;s part was merely a phase of
his confused mental condition. He saw that Haydon
did not mean to use his gun&mdash;that he intended to ignore
it, no doubt planning to regain his authority when
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
the men of the outfit returned&mdash;when he might enlist
the support of some of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woodward&#8217;s here&mdash;eh?&#8221; laughed Haydon. He
raised his voice, shouting for the man. And Harlan
saw Woodward come from behind an outbuilding,
look toward the ranchhouse, and then walk slowly
toward them.
</p>
<p>Woodward halted when within several paces of the
two, and looked from one to the other curiously, his
eyes narrowed with speculation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woodward,&#8221; directed Haydon; &#8220;hit the breeze
after the outfit and tell them to drive those cattle back
here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan grinned. &#8220;Woodward,&#8221; he said, gently;
&#8220;you climb on your cayuse an&#8217; do as Haydon tells you.
Haydon is figurin&#8217; on cashin&#8217; in when you do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon blustered. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that if Woodward goes after the boys I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; to blow you apart. I&#8217;m givin&#8217; the orders around
here!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Watching Haydon, Harlan saw that he was not exhibiting
rage, but intense interest. He was not looking
at Harlan, but at Woodward. And, turning
swiftly, his guns both leaping into his hands with the
movement&mdash;for he had a swift suspicion that Woodward
might be standing with Haydon against him&mdash;he
saw that Woodward had fallen into a crouch; that
the man&#8217;s right hand was hovering over his pistol holster,
and that his eyes were gleaming with a light that
could mean only the one thing&mdash;murder.
</p>
<p>Backing slowly away from both Haydon and Woodward,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
Harlan watched them, his guns ready for instant
action should he catch any sign that would indicate
trickery toward himself.
</p>
<p>He saw no such signs. It became plain to him that
Woodward had no eyes for anyone but Haydon, and
that Haydon&#8217;s attention was fixed upon Woodward
with an intentness that meant he had divined that
Woodward&#8217;s peculiar manner had a definite, personal
meaning.
</p>
<p>Woodward continued to advance on Haydon. He
was waving his left hand as though giving Harlan a
silent order to get out of his way, while his gaze was
centered upon Haydon with an unspoken promise of
violence, fascinating to behold.
</p>
<p>It seemed to have fascinated Haydon. Harlan saw
him shrink back, the bluster gone out of him, his face
the color of ashes. He kept stepping back, until he
brought up against the rear wall of the ranchhouse;
and there he stood, watching Woodward, his eyes
bulging with dread wonder.
</p>
<p>Harlan saw his lips move; heard his voice, hoarse
and throaty:
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a frame-up&mdash;a frame-up. Both of you are
out to get me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frame-up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was Woodward. He was a sinister figure,
with his black beard seeming to bristle with passion, his
eyes flaming with it; all his muscles tensed and quivering,
and his right hand, with clawlike fingers, poised
above the butt of his pistol.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frame-up!&#8221; he repeated, laughing hoarsely between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
his teeth. &#8220;Hell&#8217;s fire! Do you think it takes
two men to &#8216;get&#8217; you&mdash;you miserable whelp?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waitin&#8217; for this day&mdash;waitin&#8217; for it,
waitin&#8217; to get you alone&mdash;waitin&#8217; for the boys to go
so&#8217;s I could tell you somethin&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what it is. You ain&#8217;t guessin&#8217;, eh?
Listen while I tell you somethin&#8217;. The day &#8216;Drag&#8217;
Harlan got in Lamo he brought news that Lane Morgan
had been killed out in the desert. I heard the
boys sayin&#8217; you had a hand in it. But I thought that
was just talk. I didn&#8217;t believe you was that kind of a
skunk. I waited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you sent me over to the edge of the level,
near the Rancho Seco&mdash;where Harlan found that
flattened grass when he rode over here. You told me
to watch Harlan and Barbara Morgan. You said
you thought Harlan would try some sneak game with
her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can gamble I watched. I saw Harlan standin&#8217;
guard over her; I saw him follow that sneak Lawson.
I heard the shot that killed Lawson, an&#8217; I saw
Harlan tote him downstairs, an&#8217; then set on the door-sill
all night, guardin&#8217; Barbara Morgan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sneakin&#8217; game was played by you, Haydon.
When I saw Harlan headin&#8217; toward the valley the day
he come here, I lit out ahead of him. And when he
got to the timber over there I brought him in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I heard you talk that day. I heard him sayin&#8217;
that you killed Lane Morgan. He said my dad told
him you fired the shot that killed him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan started and leaned forward, amazed. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Haydon swayed, and then steadied himself with an
effort, and stared at Woodward with bulging, incredulous
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your <i>dad</i>?&#8221; he almost shrieked; &#8220;Lane Morgan
was your father?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Woodward&#8217;s grin was wolfish. He took two or
three steps toward Haydon&mdash;panther-like steps that
betrayed the lust that was upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Billy Morgan,&#8221; he said, his teeth showing in
a merciless grin; &#8220;Barbara&#8217;s brother. Flash your gun,
Haydon; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to kill you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Haydon clawed for his pistol, missing the butt in
his eagerness, and striving wildly to draw it. It
snagged on a rawhide thong that supported the holster
and his fingers were loosening in the partial grip when
Billy Morgan shot him.
</p>
<p>He flattened against the wall of the ranchhouse for
an instant, staring wildly around him; then his head
sagged forward and he slid down the wall of the
ranchhouse into the deep dust that was mounded
near it.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A DEAD MAN WALKS</h3>
</div>

<p>Harlan had paid strict attention to Lane Morgan&#8217;s
words at Sentinel Rock, and he remembered
that Morgan had told him that his son, whom
he had called &#8220;Bill,&#8221; had left the Rancho Seco on
some mission for the governor. Evidently it had not
occurred to Morgan that his son&#8217;s mission had taken
him only to the valley in which reigned those outlaws
Morgan had reviled.
</p>
<p>But it was plain to Harlan that &#8220;Billy&#8221; was here&mdash;he
had said so himself, and he had given proof that
he had been watchful and alert to Barbara&#8217;s interests.
And now was explained young Morgan&#8217;s interest in
himself. The thought that during all the days he had
spent at the Rancho Seco, his movements had been
watched by the man who had just killed Haydon,
brought a glow of ironic humor to Harlan&#8217;s eyes.
</p>
<p>During a long interval, through which Billy Morgan
stood over Haydon, watching him with a cold
savagery, Harlan kept at a respectable distance, also
watching.
</p>
<p>He saw that for Haydon the incident had been
fatal. The man&#8217;s body did not move after it slipped
to the ground beside the ranchhouse wall. Yet Morgan
watched until he was certain; then he slowly
wheeled and looked at Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles him&mdash;damn him!&#8221; he said, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
breathlessness that told of the intense strain he had
been laboring under.
</p>
<p>Still Harlan did not speak; and his guns were in
their holsters when Morgan walked close to him, grinning
wanly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to do it. There&#8217;s no use tryin&#8217; to depend
on the law in this country. You&#8217;ve seen that, yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed it,&#8221; grinned Harlan. &#8220;You&#8217;re feelin&#8217;
bad over it. I wouldn&#8217;t. If it had been my dad he
killed I couldn&#8217;t have done any different. I reckon
any man with blood in him would feel that way about
a coyote like that killin&#8217; his father. If men don&#8217;t feel
that way, why do they drag murderers to courts&mdash;where
they have courts&mdash;an&#8217; ask the law to kill them.
That&#8217;s just shovin&#8217; the responsibility onto some other
guy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve handed several guys their pass-out checks, an&#8217;
I ain&#8217;t regrettin&#8217; one of them. There wasn&#8217;t one of
them that didn&#8217;t have it comin&#8217; to him. They was
lookin&#8217; for it, mostly, an&#8217; had to have it. I&#8217;ve heard
of guys that had killed a man feelin&#8217; squeamish over it&mdash;with
ghosts visitin&#8217; them at night; an&#8217; sufferin&#8217; a lot
of mental torture. I reckon any man would feel that
way if he&#8217;d killed an inoffensive man&mdash;or a good man,
or one that hadn&#8217;t been tryin&#8217; to murder him.&#8221; He
grinned again. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;m preachin&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And now into his gaze as he looked at Morgan,
came cold reproach.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You wasn&#8217;t figurin&#8217; to let Barbara play it a lone
hand?&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hell&#8217;s fire&mdash;no!&#8221; denied Morgan, his eyes blazing.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watchin&#8217; the Rancho Seco&mdash;as I told
Haydon. I saw Barbara set out for Lamo. There
was no one followin&#8217; her, an&#8217; so I thought she&#8217;d be all
right. That mixup at Lamo slipped me. But I seen
you an&#8217; Barbara come back, an&#8217; I heard the boys
talkin&#8217; about what happened at Lamo. I&#8217;d heard of
you, too; an&#8217; when I seen you come back with Barbara
I watched you. An&#8217; I seen you was square, so I trusted
you a heap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I had a talk with Sheriff Gage about you, an&#8217;
he told me my dad had sent to Pardo for you, through
Dave Hallowell, the marshal of Pardo. Gage said
you was out to clean up Deveny an&#8217; Haydon, an&#8217; so I
knowed I could depend on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Barbara don&#8217;t know you&#8217;re hangin&#8217; around here&mdash;she
ain&#8217;t known it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks, I reckon not,&#8221; grinned Morgan. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
come here for six months after I left the Rancho Seco&mdash;until
I growed a beard. Barbara&#8217;s been within a
dozen feet of me, an&#8217; never knowed me. I&#8217;ve been
thinkin&#8217; of telling her, but I seen Haydon was sweet
on her, an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t dare tell her. Women ain&#8217;t reliable.
She&#8217;d have showed it some way, an&#8217; then
there&#8217;d have been hell to pay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve been pridin&#8217; myself on takin&#8217; care of Barbara,&#8221;
said Harlan. &#8220;I feel a heap embarrassed an&#8217;
useless&mdash;just like I&#8217;d been fooled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done a thing I couldn&#8217;t do,&#8221; confessed
Morgan; &#8220;you&#8217;ve busted Haydon&#8217;s gang wide open.
If you hadn&#8217;t showed up there&#8217;d have been nothin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
done. There&#8217;s some of the boys that ain&#8217;t outlaws&mdash;boys
that are with me, havin&#8217; sneaked into the gang to
help me out. But we wan&#8217;t makin&#8217; no headway to
speak of.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan looked at Haydon. &#8220;That guy was educated,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;What was his game? I&#8217;ve felt all
along that there was somethin&#8217; big back of him&mdash;that
he wasn&#8217;t here just to steal cattle an&#8217; rob folks, an&#8217;
such.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t heard,&#8221; smiled Morgan. &#8220;Of course
you wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;unless Gage had gassed to you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a gang of big men in Frisco, an&#8217; in the
East, figurin&#8217; to run a railroad through the basin. A
year or so ago there was secret talk of it in the capital.
It leaked out that the railroad guys was intendin&#8217; to
run their road through the basin. They was goin&#8217; to
build a town right where the Rancho Seco lays; an&#8217;
they was plannin&#8217; to irrigate a lot of the land around
there. The governor says it was to be big&mdash;an&#8217; likely
it&#8217;ll be big, when they get around to it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But them things go slow, an&#8217; a gang of cheap
crooks got wise to it. They sent Haydon down here,
to scare the folks in the basin into sellin&#8217; out for a
song. They&#8217;ve scared one man out&mdash;a Pole from the
west end. But the others have stuck. Looks like they
was figurin&#8217; on grabbin&#8217; the Rancho Seco without payin&#8217;
<i>anything</i> for it&mdash;Haydon intendin&#8217;, I reckon, to
put dad an&#8217; me out of the way an&#8217; marry Barbara.
Then he could have cut the ranch up into town lots an&#8217;
made a mint of coin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Deveny?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Deveny&#8217;s a wolf. Haydon brought him here from
Arizona&mdash;where he&#8217;d terrorized a whole county, runnin&#8217;
it regardless. He figured to cash in, I reckon,
but he&#8217;s been grabbin&#8217; up everything he could lay his
hands on, on the way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be tellin&#8217; Barbara, now?&#8221; suggested Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217;!&#8221; said Morgan, his eyes glowing.
&#8220;I&#8217;m hittin&#8217; the breeze to the Rancho Seco for fair.&#8221;
He looked at Haydon, and his eyes took on a new
expression. &#8220;I was almost forgettin&#8217; what the governor
sent me here for,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The governor
was wantin&#8217; to know who is behind Haydon an&#8217; Deveny,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m rummagin&#8217; around in Haydon&#8217;s office to
find out. Goin&#8217;?&#8221; he invited.
</p>
<p>Both looked down at Haydon as they passed him,
and an instant later they were entering a door of the
ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>They had hardly disappeared when Haydon&#8217;s head
moved slightly.
</p>
<p>His eyes were open; he glanced at the door of the
ranchhouse through which Harlan and Morgan had
entered. Then he raised his head, dragged himself to
an elbow&mdash;upon which he rested momentarily, his
face betraying the bitter malignance and triumph that
had seized him.
</p>
<p>He had realized that Morgan had meant to kill
him, even before Morgan had revealed his identity,
and his backward movement, which had brought him
against the wall of the ranchhouse had been made with
design. He had felt that even if he should succeed in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
beating Morgan, Harlan would have taken up the
quarrel, for he knew that Harlan also had designs on
his life. And with a cupidity aroused over the desperate
predicament in which he found himself, he had
decided to take a forlorn chance.
</p>
<p>Morgan&#8217;s bullet had struck him, but by a convulsive
side movement at the instant Morgan&#8217;s gun roared
Haydon had escaped a fatal wound, and the bullet had
entered his left side above the heart, paralyzing one of
the big muscles of the shoulder.
</p>
<p>His left arm was limp and useless, and dragged in
the dust as he squirmed around and gained his feet.
There was no window in the wall of the ranchhouse
on that side; and he backed away, staggering a little,
for he had lost much blood. He kept the blank wall
before him as he backed away from the house; and
when he reached his horse he was a long time getting
into the saddle. But he accomplished it at last; and
sent the horse slowly up the slope and into the timber
out of which Harlan had ridden with the black-bearded
man on the day of his first visit to the Star.
</p>
<p>Back where the trail converged with the main trail
that ran directly up the valley, Haydon, reeling in the
saddle, sent his horse at a faster pace, heading it toward
the Cache where he was certain he would find
Deveny. And as he rode the triumph in his eyes grew.
For he had heard every word of the conversation between
Harlan and Morgan, and he hoped to get to the
Cache before the two men discovered the trick he had
played upon them&mdash;before they could escape.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>DEVENY SECEDES</h3>
</div>

<p>Since the day he had heard that Harlan had appeared
at the Star and had been taken into the
outlaw band by Haydon, Deveny had exhibited fits of
a sullen moroseness that had kept his closest friends
from seeking his companionship. Those friends were
few, for Deveny&#8217;s attitude toward his men had always
been that of the ruthless tyrant; he had treated them
with an aloofness that had in it a contempt which they
could not ignore. More&mdash;he was merciless, and had
a furious temper which found its outlet in physical violence.
</p>
<p>Deveny was a fast man with the big Colt that swung
at his hip, a deadly marksman, and he needed but little
provocation to exhibit his skill. For that reason his
men kept the distance Deveny had established between
them&mdash;never attempting familiarity with him.
</p>
<p>Deveny had heard from a Star man the story of
Harlan&#8217;s coming to the Star and when a day or so
later Haydon rode into the Cache, Deveny was in a
state of furious resentment.
</p>
<p>There had been harsh words between Haydon and
Deveny; the men of the Cache had no difficulty in comprehending
that Deveny&#8217;s rage was bitter.
</p>
<p>Not even when Haydon told him that his acceptance
of Harlan had been forced by circumstances, and that
he was tricking Harlan into a state of fancied security
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
in which he could the more easily bring confusion upon
him did Deveny agree.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a damned fool, Haydon!&#8221; he told the
other, his face black with passion. &#8220;That guy is slick
as greased lightning&mdash;and faster. And he don&#8217;t mean
any good to the camp. He&#8217;s out for himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny did not intimate that his dislike of Harlan
had been caused by the latter&#8217;s interference with his
plans the day he had held Barbara Morgan a prisoner
in the room above the Eating-House in Lamo; but
Haydon, who had heard the details of the affair from
one of his men, smiled knowingly.
</p>
<p>It was not Haydon&#8217;s plan to let Deveny know he
knew of the affair, or that he cared about it if he had
heard. And so he did not mention it.
</p>
<p>But in his heart was a rage that made his thoughts
venomous; though he concealed his emotions behind
the bland, smooth smile of good-natured tolerance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll handle him, Deveny,&#8221; he said as he took leave
of the other. &#8220;He&#8217;ll get his when he isn&#8217;t expecting
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny, however, had no faith in Haydon&#8217;s ability
to &#8220;handle&#8221; Harlan. He had seen in the man&#8217;s eyes
that day in Lamo something that had troubled him&mdash;an
indomitability that seemed to indicate that the man
would do whatever he set out to do.
</p>
<p>But Deveny did not ride to the Star to see Harlan;
he was reluctant to stir outside the Cache, and for
many days, while Harlan was attaining supremacy at
the Star, and while Haydon was absent on a mysterious
mission, Deveny kept close to the Cache, nursing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
his resentment against Haydon, and deepening&mdash;with
fancied situations&mdash;his hatred for Harlan.
</p>
<p>It did not surprise Deveny when a Star man rode into
the Cache one day and told him that Harlan had
killed Latimer in a gunfight, and that Harlan was
slowly but surely gaining a following among the men.
The information did not surprise Deveny; but it sent
his mind into a chaos of conjecture and speculation,
out of which at last a conviction came&mdash;that Harlan
was seeking control of the outlaw band; that Haydon&#8217;s
days as a leader were almost over, so far as he
was concerned. For if Haydon insisted on taking
Harlan into the secret councils of the camp he&mdash;Deveny&mdash;was
going to operate independently.
</p>
<p>The more his thoughts dwelt upon that feature the
more attractive it seemed to him. Independence of
Haydon meant that he could do as he pleased without
the necessity of consulting anybody. He could rustle
whatever cattle he wanted&mdash;getting them where he
could without following Haydon&#8217;s plans&mdash;which had
always seemed rather nonsensical, embracing as they
did the scheme of railroad building and town sites;
and he could do as he pleased with Barbara Morgan,
not having to consider Haydon at all.
</p>
<p>It was that last consideration that finally decided
Deveny. He was an outlaw&mdash;not a politician; he
robbed for gain, and not for the doubtful benefits that
might be got out of the building of a town. And when
he looked with desire upon a woman he didn&#8217;t care to
share her with another man&mdash;not even Haydon.
</p>
<p>For two or three days after the conviction seized
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Deveny, he pondered over his chances, and when he
reached a decision he acted with the volcanic energy
that had characterized his depredations in the basin.
</p>
<p>On the morning of the day upon which Haydon returned
to the Star to find the cattle gone and Harlan
in control, Deveny appeared to a dozen Cache men
who were variously engaged near the corral, ordering
them to saddle their horses.
</p>
<p>Later, Deveny and his men rode southward across
a low plateau that connected the buttes near the entrance
to the Cache with the low hills that rimmed the
basin. They traveled fast, and when they reached the
rimming hills they veered eastward upon a broad sand
plain.
</p>
<p>There was a grin on Deveny&#8217;s face now&mdash;a grin
which expressed craft, duplicity, and bestial desire.
And as he rode at the head of his men he drew mental
pictures that broadened his grin and brought into his
eyes an abysmal gleam.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>KIDNAPPED</h3>
</div>

<p>Barbara Morgan had yielded to the fever
of impatience which had afflicted her during the
latter days of Harlan&#8217;s absence from the Rancho Seco.
She had been impatient ever since she had been forced
to stay close to the house by Harlan&#8217;s orders; but she
had fought it off until now, for she had been interested
in Harlan, and had felt a deep wonder over his probable
actions regarding her future.
</p>
<p>She had known, of course, that real danger from
Deveny existed, for the incident in Lamo had convinced
her of that, but she felt that Harlan&#8217;s fears for
her were rather extravagant&mdash;it was rather improbable
that Deveny would come boldly to the Rancho
Seco and attempt to carry her away by force.
</p>
<p>The clear, brilliant sunshine of the country dispelled
so grotesque a thought; the peaceful hills seemed to
smile their denial; and the broad level near the entrance
to the basin sent a calm message of reassurance
to her.
</p>
<p>She had known Red Linton for a long time&mdash;for he
had been with her father for nearly two seasons&mdash;and
she had respected him for what he had seemed to be,
a quiet, rather humorous man who did his work well,
though without flourishes. He had never figured
prominently in her thoughts, however, until the day
Harlan had appointed him foreman of the Rancho
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
Seco, and then her attention had been attracted to him
because he had seemed interested in her.
</p>
<p>And she had noted that Linton&#8217;s interest in her
seemed to grow after Harlan&#8217;s departure. He had
talked with her several times, and she had questioned
him about Harlan&#8217;s whereabouts. But Linton had not
seemed to know; at least, if he did know, he kept his
knowledge strictly to himself, not even intimating that
he knew where Harlan had gone.
</p>
<p>Another thing she noted was that Linton seemed to
have her under surveillance. Whenever she left the
house&mdash;even for a short ride eastward&mdash;where Harlan
had told her she might ride without danger&mdash;she
discovered that Linton immediately mounted his horse,
to linger somewhere in sight.
</p>
<p>The knowledge that she was watched began to irritate
her and this morning she had got up with a determination
to ride without company. With that end in
view she had kept Billy all night in the patio; and
when rather late in the morning she saw Linton riding
eastward, she hurriedly threw saddle and bridle on the
horse and rode westward, toward the big basin.
</p>
<p>She kept the house between her and the point where
she had seen Linton&mdash;until a turn northward became
inevitable; and then she urged Billy to a faster pace,
in an endeavor to cross the wide plain that reached
to the entrance to the basin before Linton could see
her.
</p>
<p>Many times during the days before the coming of
Deveny and Haydon to the valley she had ridden
there; it had been a place in which reigned a mighty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
silence which she had loved, which had thrilled her.
During those other days she was in the habit of riding
to a point several miles up the valley&mdash;between the
little basin where the Star was now and the Rancho
Seco.
</p>
<p>The trail led upward in a slow, gradual slope to that
point&mdash;a rugged promontory that jutted out from a
mesa that rose above the floor of the valley. The
mesa was fringed at the southern edge with stunt oak
and nondescript brush. But there were breaks in the
fringe which permitted her to ride close to the edge
of the mesa; and from there she could look many miles
up the valley&mdash;and across it, where the solemn hills
rimmed the southern horizon, to a trail&mdash;called the
South Trail by cattlemen in the valley, to distinguish
it from the main trail leading through the mighty hollow
in which she rode.
</p>
<p>When she reached the mesa she headed Billy directly
for the break on the promontory. Dismounting, she
stretched her legs to disperse the saddle weariness; then
she found a huge rock which had been the seat from
which she had viewed the wondrous landscape in the
past.
</p>
<p>The reverent awe with which she had always viewed
the valley was as strong in her today as it had ever
been&mdash;stronger, in fact, because she had not seen the
place for some time, and because in her heart there
now dwelt a sadness that had not been there in those
other days&mdash;at least since her mother had died.
</p>
<p>She was high above the floor of the valley; and she
could see the main trail below her weaving around low
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
mounds and sinking into depressions; disappearing into
timber groves, reappearing farther on, disappearing
again, and again reappearing until it grew blurred and
indistinct in her vision.
</p>
<p>In the marvelous clarity of the atmosphere this
morning every beauteous feature of the valley was
disclosed to her inspection. The early morning haze
had lifted, and the few fleecy clouds that floated in
the blue bowl of sky were motionless, their majestic
billows glowing in the sun. She saw a Mexican eagle
swoop over the cloud, sailing on slow wing high above
it, and growing so distant in her vision that he became
a mere speck moving in the limitless expanse of space.
</p>
<p>It was a colossal landscape, and its creator had
neglected no detail. And it was harmonious, from the
emerald green that carpeted the floor of the valley
near the gleaming river to the gigantic shoulders of
the rugged hills that lifted their huge, bastioned walls
into the blue of the sky. Some tall rock spires that
thrust their peaks skyward far over on the southern
side of the valley had always interested her; they
seemed to be sentinels that guarded the place, hinting
of an ages-old mystery that seemed to reign all about
them.
</p>
<p>But there was mystery in everything in the valley,
she felt; for it lay before her, spreading, slumbrous,
basking in the brilliant sunlight&mdash;seeming to wait,
as it seemed to have waited from the dawn of the
first day, for man to wonder over it.
</p>
<p>She saw the Mexican eagle again after a while. It
was making a wide circle beyond the rock spires, floating
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
lazily above them in long, graceful swoops that
were so lacking in effort that she longed to be up there
with him&mdash;to ride the air with him, to feel the exhilaration
he must feel.
</p>
<p>As she looked, however, she caught a faint blur on
the southern horizon of the big picture&mdash;a yellowish-black
cloud that hugged the horizon and traveled
rapidly eastward. It was some time before she
realized that what she saw was a dust cloud, and there
were men in it&mdash;horsemen.
</p>
<p>She got up from the rock, her face slowly whitening.
And into her heart came a presentiment that
those men in the dust cloud were abroad upon an
errand of evil.
</p>
<p>No doubt the presentiment was caused from the
dread and fear she had lived under for days&mdash;the
consciousness that Deveny was in the valley, and
a recollection of the warnings that Harlan had given
her. And she knew the horsemen could not be Rancho
Seco men&mdash;for they had gone southward from the
ranch, and there was no grass range where the horsemen
were riding. Also, the men were riding eastward,
toward the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>Trembling a little with apprehension, she mounted
Billy and sent him down the slope to the floor of the
valley. The descent was hazardous, and Billy did
not make good time, but when he reached the level
at the foot of the slope he stretched his neck and fell
into a steady, rapid pace that took him down the valley
swiftly.
</p>
<p>As the girl rode, the presentiment of evil increased,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
and she grew nervous with a conviction that she
would not be able to reach the Rancho Seco much in
advance of the men. For she could see them more
clearly now, because they were in the valley, traveling
a shelving trail that sloped down from the hills toward
the level that stretched to the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>It was several miles from where she rode to the
point where the horsemen were riding, and she was
traversing a long ridge which must have revealed her
to the men if they looked toward her.
</p>
<p>She had thought&mdash;after she had left the promontory&mdash;of
concealing herself somewhere in the valley,
to wait until she discovered who the men were and
what their errand was; but she had a fear that if the
men were Deveny&#8217;s outlaws they might return up the
valley and accidentally come upon her. Also, she had
yielded to the homing instinct which is strong in all
living beings, for at home was safety that could not
be found elsewhere.
</p>
<p>The South Trail, she knew, converged with the
valley trail at the edge of the level. If she could
reach that point a few minutes before the horsemen
reached it she would rely on Billy to maintain his
lead. Billy would have to maintain it!
</p>
<p>Leaning far over Billy&#8217;s mane she urged him on,
coaxing him, flattering him, calling to him in terms
of endearment. And the loyal little animal did his
best, running as he had never run before.
</p>
<p>Barbara though, watching the horsemen with eyes
into which there had come a glow of doubt, began
to realize that Billy was losing the race. Also, by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
the time she had gone four or five miles, she discovered
that the men had seen her. For the trails were growing
close together now&mdash;not more than half a mile
of slightly broken country stretched between them, and
she could see the men waving their hats; could hear
their voices above the whir and clatter of Billy&#8217;s
passing.
</p>
<p>Still, she was determined to win, and Billy&#8217;s flanks
felt the sting of the quirt that, hitherto, had swung
from Barbara&#8217;s wrist.
</p>
<p>Billy revealed a marvelous burst of speed. But it
did not last, and the horsemen, after hanging for an
instant abreast of Billy, began to forge ahead.
</p>
<p>The courageous little animal had almost reached
the covert that Harlan had discovered the day he had
visited the Star the first time, and was nobly answering
the stern urge of the quirt when another horseman
suddenly appeared on the trail directly ahead of the
girl, seemingly having ridden out of the covert.
</p>
<p>The trail was narrow, and Billy could not swerve
around the new rider. So, sensing the danger of a
collision he stiffened his legs, making a sliding halt that
carried him a dozen feet, leaving him upon his
haunches with Barbara frantically trying to keep to
the saddle.
</p>
<p>Then Billy&#8217;s forehoofs came down; he grunted,
heaved a tremendous sigh and stood, his legs braced,
awaiting orders.
</p>
<p>No order came. For no words escaped Barbara&#8217;s
lips. She sat in the saddle, her face ashen, terror
clutching her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>For the horseman who had ridden out of the covert
was Stroud, the Rancho Seco straw-boss. He was
grinning, and in his eyes was a gloating triumph that
she could not mistake.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky I took a notion to come in this mornin&#8217;,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I just got here. I seen you hittin&#8217; the
breeze for fair while you was quite a piece up the
basin; an&#8217; I seen Deveny an&#8217; the boys a-fannin&#8217; it, too.
An&#8217; I says to myself: &#8216;Stroud, here&#8217;s Deveny racin&#8217;
to see Miss Barbara, an&#8217; her actin&#8217; like she don&#8217;t want
to see him. But I&#8217;ll fix it so she does.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl touched Billy with the quirt, and the little
animal lunged forward, close to Stroud&#8217;s horse. As
the two beasts came close together Barbara struck at
Stroud with the quirt, hoping to disconcert him so that
she could send Billy past him.
</p>
<p>Stroud ducked and shot a hand out, seized the quirt
and wrenched it from her hand. She screamed as the
hairloop scraped the flesh of her wrist. And then
she heard a thundering clatter of hoofs and saw Deveny
and his men appear from beyond the covert and
race toward her.
</p>
<p>Deveny spoke no word. But as he rode toward
her she saw the gleam in his eyes, and she silently
fought Stroud, who had grasped her and was pulling
her toward him.
</p>
<p>It seemed to her that Deveny must have misunderstood
Stroud&#8217;s action, for it was clear to her&mdash;even
in the stress and confusion of the moment&mdash;that
Deveny thought Stroud had attacked her through
motives that were strictly personal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>Anyway, before Stroud could speak Deveny&#8217;s pistol
glittered. And malignantly, his eyes blazing with a
jealous, evil light, he shot Stroud&mdash;twice.
</p>
<p>He sat in the saddle, his lips twitching into a sneer
as he watched the straw-boss tumble from his horse
and fall limply into the grass. Then with a smile
that was hideous with a triumphant passion, he spurred
his horse to Billy&#8217;s side, pulled the girl from the saddle,
and sent his horse up the valley, motioning his men
to follow.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>AMBUSHED</h3>
</div>

<p>Red Linton had ridden eastward to examine
the grass of the range in that direction, for it
had been some days since he had sent Stroud to the
southern range, and since the cattle had been there
for some time before that Linton felt they should be
driven to fresh grass.
</p>
<p>And yet, perhaps, Linton&#8217;s search for good grass
should not have taken him so far from the ranchhouse,
for he remembered his promise to Harlan that
he would not let Barbara out of his sight. But Barbara
had made no objection to his guardianship of
her, so far, and he had longed for a ride.
</p>
<p>He worried a little, though, and felt guilty of something
very like treason to Harlan; and at last, not
being able to ride farther with the thoughts that
fought with his desires, he wheeled his horse and sent
it scampering back toward the ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>When he reached the ranchhouse he saw none of
the men, for he had set them at tasks inside the buildings;
and he rode down to the ranchhouse, resolved
to have a talk with the girl.
</p>
<p>When he rode around the near corner he saw that
the <i>patio</i> gate was open. His horse leaped with the
stern word he spoke to it, bringing him swiftly to the
gate, where he dismounted and threw open a door
that led into the house.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>He called to Barbara, and receiving no answer, he
ran from room to room, not hesitating until he had
explored them all.
</p>
<p>Emerging from the house, he mounted his horse
and sent him westward, while he scanned the big level
around him for sight of the girl.
</p>
<p>She had always ridden into the valley in former
days, he remembered&mdash;and during the days of his
guardianship she had more than once threatened to
ride there. And he had no doubt she had gone there
now, out of perverseness, just to irritate him.
</p>
<p>He held his horse to a rapid pace as he crossed the
level, and he was still a mile distant from the covert
where Barbara had met Stroud when he saw a group
of horsemen traveling rapidly up the valley.
</p>
<p>Linton rode on, his anxiety acute, a grave suspicion
afflicting him. And when, after he had ridden a little
farther, he saw Barbara&#8217;s horse trotting slowly toward
him, the stirrups swinging and flopping emptily against
the saddle skirts, he drew a deep breath and brought
his own horse to a halt, while he sat motionless in
the saddle, tortured by bitter thoughts.
</p>
<p>He had no doubt that what Harlan feared would
happen, had happened&mdash;that Deveny had come for
Barbara. And Deveny had found her, through <i>his</i>
dereliction. He had relaxed his vigilance for only a
short time, and during that time Deveny had come.
</p>
<p>Linton looked back toward the Rancho Seco. The
distance to the ranchhouse seemed to be interminable.
He looked again up the valley, and saw that the horsemen
were growing indistinct. Within a few minutes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
so rapid was their pace, they would vanish altogether.
</p>
<p>Linton thought of going back to the ranchhouse
for the other men&mdash;that was why he had looked in
that direction. But if he wished to keep the horsemen
in sight he would not have time to get the other
men. Before he could get the men and return to
where he now stood Deveny would have taken the
girl to that mysterious and unknown rendezvous in
the hills in which his band had always concealed themselves,
and Barbara would be lost.
</p>
<p>Linton&#8217;s lips straightened. He was to blame.
</p>
<p>He knew the danger that would attend the action
of following Deveny&#8217;s men up the valley. Other men
had attempted to trail them, and they had been found
murdered, often with warnings upon them.
</p>
<p>But Linton hesitated only momentarily. With a
grim smile for his chances of emerging unscathed from
the valley, he urged his horse up the trail, riding hard.
</p>
<p>Several miles he had traveled, keeping the horsemen
in sight, and he was beginning to believe that he would
succeed where others had failed, when, passing through
a clump of timber he detected movement in some brush
at a little distance back.
</p>
<p>Divining that Deveny had seen him and had sent a
man into the timber to ambush him, Linton threw himself
flat on the horse&#8217;s mane. He felt a bullet sing
past him, coming from the right, and he got his pistol
out and was swinging its muzzle toward the point from
which the bullet had come when a gun roared at his
left.
</p>
<p>He felt a hot, searing pain in his side, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
reeled in the saddle from the shock. Instantly another
bullet struck him, coming from the right. His
pistol dropped from his weakening fingers, he toppled
sidewise and tumbled limply into the dust.
</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, seemingly while he was in a state
of coma, he heard hoofbeats, rapidly growing distant.
</p>
<p>He knew they were Deveny&#8217;s men and he yielded
to a vague wonder as to why they had not made sure
of their work.
</p>
<p>Doggedly, and with long and bitter effort, Linton
began to turn himself so that he could get up. The
pain from his wounds was excruciating, so that each
muscular effort brought a retching groan from him.
Yet he kept moving, twisting himself around until he
got on his knees. From that position he tried a number
of times to get to his feet, but he failed each time.
</p>
<p>At last, though, with the help of a boulder that lay
beside the trail, he got his feet under him and stood
for an instant, staggering weakly. Then he began
to move forward to his horse. When he managed
at last to clutch the saddle skirt he was reeling, his
knees bending under him. However, he managed to
get one leg over the saddle, taking a long time to do
it; and eventually he was in the seat.
</p>
<p>He spent another long interval lashing himself to
the saddle with the rope that he carried at the pommel;
and then headed the horse toward the Rancho
Seco.
</p>
<p>He began to ride, urging the horse to what seemed
to him a rapid pace. But he had not gone very far
when he sagged against the pommel, lifelessly.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>ROGERS TAKES A HAND</h3>
</div>

<p>The trail herd had made good progress through
the valley, and Rogers, aided by the Star men,
had kept them going. The men feared no interference
with the work, for they had terrorized the ranchers
in the valley until the latter well knew the futility
of retaliatory measures. Still, a certain furtive quickness
of movement had always characterized the operations
of the outlaws&mdash;the instinct to move secretly, if
possible, and to strike swiftly when they struck was
always strong in them.
</p>
<p>Besides, the drive to Willow&#8217;s Wells was not a long
one, and the cattle could stand a fast pace. So it was
not long after the herd had left the Star until it
straggled up a defile in the hills and out upon the level
where Deveny&#8217;s men had to ride to take the south
trail to the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>The level extended southward for a distance of
several miles to a grass range that the Star men knew
well&mdash;for there had been times when they had grazed
cattle there, making camp on their frequent trips to
the Wells.
</p>
<p>A range of low, flat hills marked the northern limits
of the grazing section; and Rogers and his men trailed
the cattle through the hills while the morning was
still young.
</p>
<p>The herd was through the hills, and Rogers, twisting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
in the saddle, was taking a last look over the
plain to make certain there had been no prying eyes
watching the movements of himself and the men, when
he saw, far to the west, a group of horsemen just coming
into view at the edge of the plain&mdash;seemingly
having ridden out of the big valley.
</p>
<p>Rogers wheeled his horse and watched the horsemen
as they traveled eastward, making good time.
He called to a man, named Colver, who was riding
close to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s Deveny&#8217;s men&mdash;from the Cache. What
in blazes are they up to? Somethin&#8217;s in the wind,
Colver&mdash;they&#8217;re ridin&#8217; like the devil was after them
an&#8217; burnin&#8217; the breeze for fair!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rogers sent his horse scampering to the crest of
one of the hills where, concealed behind some brush,
he watched the progress of Deveny&#8217;s men eastward.
</p>
<p>When they passed the point on the plain where they
would have to veer northward if they intended to visit
the Star, he breathed with relief. For he had almost
yielded to a conviction that Deveny <i>was</i> headed for
the Star.
</p>
<p>But after the horsemen passed the point that led to
the Star trail, a new anxiety seized Rogers&mdash;and a
passion that sent the blood to his face swept over him.
</p>
<p>His eyes were glowing with an excitement that he
could not repress when he turned to Colver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Somethin&#8217;s up!&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;Deveny&#8217;s been
sullen as hell for a good many days&mdash;ever since Harlan
came to the Star. One of the boys was tellin&#8217; me
he heard Deveny an&#8217; Haydon havin&#8217; it out over at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
the Cache. If there&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a ruckus I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to be in on it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He leaped his horse off the hill, racing him down
into the grass plain after the other men. When he
reached them he yelled sharply, and they spurred
quickly to him, anticipating from his manner that
danger threatened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a hunch that hell&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; to pop right
sudden, boys,&#8221; he told them. &#8220;An&#8217; we&#8217;re goin&#8217; away
from it. If there&#8217;s any trouble we want to be in on it.
Deveny&#8217;s up to somethin&#8217;. You-all know about the
agreement made between Haydon an&#8217; Harlan&mdash;that
Harlan was to run the Rancho Seco without interference.
Deveny&#8217;s headed that way, an&#8217; Haydon ain&#8217;t
around. It&#8217;s up to us boys to keep our eyes open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan&#8217;s at the Star. He won&#8217;t be knowin&#8217; that
Deveny is headin&#8217; for the Rancho Seco. Harlan&#8217;s
white, boys; he&#8217;s done more for us guys since he&#8217;s
been at the Star than Haydon or Deveny ever done
for us. He&#8217;s promised us things that Haydon an&#8217;
Deveny would never do. He&#8217;s a white man, an&#8217; I&#8217;m
for him. An&#8217; I&#8217;m for takin&#8217; orders from him from
now on. Who&#8217;s with me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217;!&#8221; declared Colver.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for a new deal,&#8221; muttered another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re doin&#8217; the yappin&#8217;,&#8221; grimly announced a
big man who was close to Rogers; &#8220;we&#8217;re followin&#8217;
your lead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m jumpin&#8217; for the Star then!&#8221; declared Rogers;
&#8220;to put Harlan wise to where Deveny&#8217;s headed for.
We&#8217;re leavin&#8217; the herd here until we find out what&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
goin&#8217; on. Half of you guys beat it to the Rancho
Seco&mdash;trailin&#8217; Deveny an&#8217; his boys, to find out what
they&#8217;re doin&#8217;. You&#8217;re herd-ridin&#8217; them if they go to
monkeyin&#8217; with the Rancho Seco. Slope!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rogers had hardly ceased speaking when the outfit
was on the move. There were eleven men, including
Rogers; and they sent their horses leaping over the
crest of the hill nearest them&mdash;dividing, as they
reached the level on the other side with seemingly no
previous arrangement, into two groups&mdash;one group
going northeastward, toward the South Trail, and the
other fading into the space that yawned between it and
the point where the trail to the Star led downward into
the big basin.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Haydon, holding hard to the pommel of the saddle,
urging his horse along the trail that led up the valley,
looked back whenever he reached a rise, his eyes
searching the space behind him for the dread apparition
that he expected momentarily.
</p>
<p>He knew that it would not be long before Morgan
and Harlan would emerge from the ranchhouse to discover
that he had escaped; and he knew, too, that they
would suspect that he had gone to the Cache.
</p>
<p>He expected they would delay riding after him,
however, until they searched for him in some of the
buildings, and that delay, he hoped, would give him
time to reach the Cache.
</p>
<p>He was handicapped by his useless arm&mdash;for it
made riding awkward, and the numbness was stealing
down his side, toward his leg. He paid little attention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
to the pain; indeed, he entirely forgot it in his
frenzied eagerness to reach the Cache.
</p>
<p>More prominent in his brain at this minute than
any other emotion was a dread of Billy Morgan. He
had yielded to terror when Morgan had revealed his
identity; but the terror he had felt then had not been
nearly so paralyzing as that which was now upon him.
</p>
<p>His eyes were bulging as he rode; his lips were
slavering, and he shuddered and cringed as he leaned
over his horse&#8217;s mane, urging him to greater effort&mdash;even
though there were times when his lurches almost
threw him out of the saddle.
</p>
<p>For his previous terror had been somewhat tempered
with a doubt of Morgan&#8217;s veracity. Even when he
had seen Morgan reaching for his pistol he had felt
the doubt&mdash;had felt that Morgan was not Morgan at
all, but Woodward, perpetrating a grotesque joke.
To be sure, when he had seen that Morgan really intended
to kill him, he had been convinced that the
man was in deadly earnest. It had been then that
he had desperately twisted himself so that Morgan&#8217;s
bullet had not touched a vital spot.
</p>
<p>But now his terror had grown; it was a thing that
had got into his soul&mdash;for he had had time to meditate
over what Morgan&#8217;s vengeance meant to him.
</p>
<p>It meant that Morgan would kill him, if he caught
him; that the life he treasured would be taken from
him; that the magnificent body which he had always
so greatly admired would be shattered and broken.
The mental picture he drew further increased his
terror, and he began to mutter incoherent blasphemies
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
as he raced his horse at a breakneck pace toward the
Cache.
</p>
<p>But when he had ridden several miles and knew
from the appearance of the valley that he was nearing
the Cache and that he would reach it in safety, there
came a change in him.
</p>
<p>He grew calmer; he began to feel a rage that sent
the blood racing through his veins again. He looked
back over the trail as often as formerly, but it was
with a new expression&mdash;malevolent hatred. And
when he finally reached the entrance to the Cache and
rode through it, heading toward the building in which,
he expected, he would find Deveny, the malevolence
in his expression was mingled with triumph and
cunning.

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>A DUAL TRAGEDY</h3>
</div>

<p>Harlan and Morgan had made a thorough
search of Haydon&#8217;s desk in the latter&#8217;s office
in the ranchhouse, and they had found letters addressed
to Haydon&mdash;received at various towns in the vicinity
and proving Morgan&#8217;s charges against him. And
upon several of the letters were names that provided
damaging evidence of the connection of influential men
with the scheme to gain unlawful possession of much
land in the basin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This cinches it!&#8221; declared Morgan as he carefully
placed the letters into a pocket when he and Harlan
emerged from the ranchhouse. &#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ve got
proof now. An&#8217; the governor&#8217;ll be plumb tickled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They stepped down from the doorway and turned
the corner of the house. Instantly they noted the
disappearance of Haydon&#8217;s body. But they did not
search among the other buildings for Haydon&mdash;as
he had expected them to do. For they saw that his
horse was also missing.
</p>
<p>Morgan ran for the corral, saying no word, his
lips set in grim, vengeful lines. He had been a fool
for not making sure that he had killed Haydon, but
he would not make that mistake again. The gleam
in his eyes revealed that.
</p>
<p>Harlan, too, divined what had happened. Purgatory
was in the stable&mdash;which was farther from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
ranchhouse than the corral. And though Harlan
moved swiftly Morgan was already on his horse and
racing toward the timber when Purgatory emerged
from the stable, saddled and bridled.
</p>
<p>Harlan noted that Morgan had not stopped to
saddle his horse, and that omission revealed the man&#8217;s
intense desire for haste. Harlan, however, headed
Purgatory into the timber, but he was more than half
a mile behind Morgan when he reached the main trail.
</p>
<p>He saw Morgan riding the trail that led up the
valley, and he set out after him, giving the big black
horse the rein. He divined that Morgan suspected
Haydon had ridden in that direction; and while Harlan
had never seen the Cache, he had heard the Star
men speak of it, and he had noticed that when setting
out for it they had always traveled the trail Morgan
was traveling. Therefore, it was evident that Morgan
thought Haydon had gone to the Cache. In that
case he depended upon Deveny to assist him&mdash;if Morgan
followed; and Harlan was determined to see the
incident through.
</p>
<p>He sent Purgatory ahead at a good pace, but he
noted soon that Morgan was increasing the distance
between them. He began to urge Purgatory forward,
and gradually the distance between the two riders
grew shorter.
</p>
<p>Both were traveling rapidly, however, and it seemed
to Harlan that they had not gone more than three
or four miles when&mdash;watching Morgan closely, he
saw him ride pell-mell into some timber that&mdash;apparently&mdash;fringed
the front of a cave.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>It was some time before Harlan reached the timber,
and when he did he could not immediately discover
the spot into which Morgan had ridden. When
he did discover it he rode Purgatory through, and
found himself in a narrow gorge.
</p>
<p>He raced Purgatory through the gorge, and out of
it to the sloping side of a little basin.
</p>
<p>He saw a house near the center of the basin&mdash;and
Morgan riding close to it.
</p>
<p>The distance to the house was not great&mdash;not more
than a quarter of a mile, it seemed; and Harlan felt
some wonder that Morgan&mdash;who had been quite a
little in advance of him&mdash;had not reached the house
sooner. That mystery was explained to him almost
instantly, though, when he saw that Morgan&#8217;s horse
was walking, going forward with a pronounced limp.
Evidently Morgan had met with an accident.
</p>
<p>Harlan was riding across the floor of the little basin,
watching Morgan and wondering at the seeming
absence of Deveny&#8217;s men, when he saw a smoke streak
issue from one of the windows of the house, saw Morgan
reel in the saddle, and slide to the ground.
</p>
<p>But before Harlan could reach the spot where Morgan
had fallen, the man staggered to his feet and was
running toward the house, swaying as he went.
</p>
<p>Harlan heard a muffled report as he sent Purgatory
scampering after Morgan. He saw Morgan reel
again, and he knew someone in the house was using a
rifle.
</p>
<p>There was another report as Morgan lurched
through an open doorway of the house. Then Harlan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
knew Morgan was using his gun, for its roaring
crash mingled with the whiplike crack of a rifle.
</p>
<p>The firing had ceased when Harlan slipped off
Purgatory at the open door; and both his guns were
out as he leaped over the threshold.
</p>
<p>He halted, though, standing rigid, his guns slowly
swagging in his hands, their muzzles drooping.
</p>
<p>For on the floor of the room&mdash;flat on his back
near a corner&mdash;was Haydon. He was dead&mdash;there
was no doubt of that.
</p>
<p>Nor was there any doubt that the bullets Haydon
had sent had finished Morgan. He was lying on his
right side, his right arm under him, extended; the palm
of the hand upward, the fingers limply holding the
pistol he had used, some smoke curling lazily from the
muzzle.
</p>
<p>Harlan knelt beside Morgan, examining him for
signs of life. He got up a little later and stood for
some time looking down at the man, thinking of Barbara.
Twice had tragedy cast its sinister shadow over
her.
</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>CONVERGING TRAILS</h3>
</div>

<p>An hour or so later, Harlan, having finished his
labors in a clearing at the edge of the level near
the gorge, climbed slowly on Purgatory and sent him
back down the valley trail toward the Star.
</p>
<p>From the first his sympathies for Barbara had been
deep, beginning on the evening Lane Morgan had
mentioned her in his presence&mdash;when the man seemed
to see her in that strange, awesome moment before his
death&mdash;when he had seemed to hold out his arms to
her. Later, at Lamo, when Harlan had held the girl
in his arms, he felt that at that instant he must have
experienced much the same protective impulse that
Morgan would have felt, had the experience occurred
to him. Harlan had been slightly cynical until that
minute; but since then he had known that his rage
against the outlaws was deeply personal.
</p>
<p>That rage, though, had centered most heavily upon
Deveny. He had hated Haydon, too&mdash;from the
first. In the beginning it had been a jealous hatred,
aroused over the conviction that Barbara loved the
man. But later&mdash;when he had discovered that Haydon
was the mysterious &#8220;Chief,&#8221; that he was the real
murderer of Lane Morgan, and that behind his professed
love for the girl was meditated trickery&mdash;his
hatred had become a passion in which Barbara did
not figure.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>His hatred for Haydon, though, could not be compared
with the passionate contempt and loathing he
felt for Deveny. The man had attempted, in Lamo,
a thing that Harlan had always abhorred, and the
memory of that time was still vivid in Harlan&#8217;s brain.
</p>
<p>Into Harlan&#8217;s heart as he rode toward the Star
flamed that ancient loathing, paling his face and bringing
a gleam to his eyes that had been in them often
of late&mdash;a lust for the lives of the men whose evil
deeds and sinister influence had kept Barbara a virtual
prisoner at the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>He rode the valley trail slowly, his thoughts upon
Barbara, his lips straightening when he thought of
how he would have to return to the Rancho Seco, some
day, to tell her of her brother&#8217;s death. Twice had
tragedy visited her, and again he would be the messenger
to bring her the grim news.
</p>
<p>When he reached the Star he rode up to the corral
fence and dismounted. He stood for a long time at
the fence, his elbows on one of the rails, his thoughts
dwelling upon Barbara. Pity for her whitened his face,
set his lips in rigid lines.
</p>
<p>She had been in danger, but it seemed to him that
it would soon be over. For Haydon would bother
the girl no more, and as soon as he could meet Deveny
he would remove another menace to Barbara&#8217;s life
and happiness.
</p>
<p>He had no regrets for the men he had killed; they
deserved what he had given them. As he had told
Morgan, he had considered himself merely an instrument
of the law of right and justice&mdash;which law
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
was based upon the very principle that governed men
in civilized communities.
</p>
<p>He was facing south, and he raised his head after
a few minutes, for upon the slight breeze was borne to
him the rapid drumming of hoofs. As he looked up
he saw, far out toward the southern edge of the valley,
a dust cloud, moving swiftly toward him.
</p>
<p>At first he suspected that the men in the group belonged
to Deveny, and he drew out his pistols, one
after the other, and examined them&mdash;for he decided&mdash;if
Deveny was among the men&mdash;to settle for good
the question of power and authority that Haydon had
raised.
</p>
<p>When the men came closer, though, swooping
toward the ranchhouse like feathers before a hurricane,
he saw that Rogers was among them.
</p>
<p>Then, as the men came toward him down along
the corral fence, Harlan saw that Rogers&#8217; eyes were
wide with excitement. And he stood, his face darkening,
as Rogers told him what he had seen, and
voiced his suspicions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re with you, Harlan,&#8221; declared Rogers, sweeping
a hand toward the men; &#8220;an&#8217; them other boys
which have trailed Deveny, are with you. We&#8217;re out
to &#8216;get&#8217; Deveny if you say the word; and that thief,
Haydon, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan did not answer. He grinned at the men,
though, and at Rogers&mdash;acknowledging his gratitude
for their decision to be &#8220;with&#8221; him; then he turned,
leaped on Purgatory, and sent the big beast thundering
toward the timber that led to the main trail.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>Their voices silent, their horses falling quickly into
the pace set by the big black, Rogers and the other
men followed.
</p>
<p>The other half of Rogers&#8217; men, headed by Colver,
were several miles behind Deveny&#8217;s horsemen when
they reached the South Trail. They gained very little
on the other men, though, for Deveny and his men
were just then racing Barbara to the point where the
trails converged, having seen her. But during
Deveny&#8217;s halt at the covert, where he had shot Stroud,
Colver&#8217;s men gained, and they were not more than
two or three miles from the covert when Deveny&#8217;s
men left it.
</p>
<p>From the shelving trail, ever sweeping toward the
trail in the valley, Colver had noted the halt at the
covert, though he had not seen Barbara, nor Stroud.
He had seen, of course, that Deveny had not gone to
the Rancho Seco, that for some reason or other he
had swerved, taking the trail up the valley.
</p>
<p>Colver was puzzled, but he remembered Rogers&#8217;
orders, and when he and his men reached the covert,
they halted. They came upon Stroud, lying near some
bushes, and they saw his horse, grazing on the tall
grass near by. They had reached the covert too late
to see Barbara&#8217;s pony; and when they remounted, after
taking a look at Stroud, they caught a glimpse of a
lone horseman racing up the valley in the direction
taken by Deveny and his men.
</p>
<p>The lone horseman was Red Linton, though Colver
did not know it, for the South Trail dipped into the
basin miles before it emerged to the level at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
point of convergence with the other trail, and Colver
had not seen Linton when he had passed.
</p>
<p>Colver and his men fled up the valley, following the
trail taken by Deveny and the lone horseman, and
when they had gone two or three miles they saw a
rider coming toward them. They raced toward him,
for they saw he was in trouble; that he had lashed
himself to the pommel of the saddle, and that he was
leaning far over it, limp and inert.
</p>
<p>Linton was not unconscious, but he was very near
it; so near that he seemed to dream that men were
around him and that voices were directed at him.
</p>
<p>Into his mind as he straightened and looked at the
men finally came the conviction that this was not a
dream; and after an instant of intense effort, during
which he fixed his gaze on Colver, he recognized the
other.
</p>
<p>He laughed, grimly, mockingly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Front an&#8217; rear&mdash;eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You got me,
goin&#8217; an&#8217; comin&#8217;. Well, go to it&mdash;I deserve it, for
lettin&#8217; Barbara out of my sight. If you don&#8217;t kill me,
Harlan will. But if you guys are <i>men</i>, you won&#8217;t let
Deveny&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deveny&#8217;s got Barbara Morgan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was Colver. Something in his voice straightened
Linton further, and he steadied himself in the
saddle and looked fairly at the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deveny&#8217;s got her. An&#8217; they got me&mdash;chasin&#8217;
&#8217;em. I was headin&#8217; back to the Rancho Seco, to get
the T Down boys&mdash;all Harlan&#8217;s friends&mdash;to wipe
Deveny out. If you guys are <i>men</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>Sheer will could no longer support Linton&#8217;s failing
muscles&mdash;and he again collapsed over the pommel.
</p>
<p>For an instant only did Colver hesitate. Then he
turned to a lean rider who bestrode a tall, rangy horse.
He spoke sharply to the rider:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit the breeze to the Rancho Seco, an&#8217; get them
T Down boys. Fan it, damn you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rider was off with the word, leaping his horse
down the trail with dizzying speed. Then Colver
loosed the rope that held Linton to the saddle, and
with the help of the other men lifted the man down
and stretched him in a plot of grass beside the trail,
where they worked over him until they saw, far out
on the level toward the Rancho Seco, a number of
horsemen coming, seemingly abreast, as though they
were racing, each man trying his best to outstrip the
others.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>WORLD&#8217;S END</h3>
</div>

<p>Barbara Morgan had fought Deveny until
she became exhausted. Thereafter she lay
quiet, breathing fast, yielding to the nameless terror
that held her in its icy clutch.
</p>
<p>The appearance of Deveny so soon after the end
of the heartbreaking ride down the trail had brought
into her heart a sense of the futility of resistance&mdash;and
yet she had resisted, involuntarily, instinctively.
Yet resistance had merely served to increase the
exhaustion that had come upon her.
</p>
<p>She had not known&mdash;until she lay passive in
Deveny&#8217;s arms&mdash;how taut her nerves had been, nor
how the physical ordeal had drained her strength.
</p>
<p>She felt the strain, now, but consideration for her
body was overwhelmed by what she saw in Deveny&#8217;s
eyes as she lay watching him.
</p>
<p>There were a dozen men with Deveny&mdash;she had
seen them, counted them when they had been racing
down the shelving trail on the other side of the valley.
And she knew they were following Deveny, for she
could hear the thudding of hoofs behind.
</p>
<p>Deveny&#8217;s big arms were around her; she could feel
the rippling of his muscles as he swayed from side to
side, balancing himself in the saddle. He was not
using the reins; he was giving his attention to her,
letting the horse follow his own inclinations.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>Yet she noted that the animal held to the trail, that
he traveled steadily, requiring no word from his rider.
</p>
<p>Once, after they had ridden some distance up the
valley, Barbara heard a man behind them call
Deveny&#8217;s attention to some horsemen who were riding
the shelving trail that Deveny and his men had
taken on their way to the level; and she heard Deveny
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the Star gang, I reckon. Mebbe Haydon,
goin&#8217; to the Rancho Seco, to see his girl.&#8221; He
grinned down into Barbara&#8217;s face, his own alight with
a triumph that made a shiver run over her.
</p>
<p>Later&mdash;only a few minutes, it seemed&mdash;she heard
a man call to Deveny again, telling him that a lone
rider was &#8220;fannin&#8217; it&#8221; up the valley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like that guy, Linton,&#8221; said the man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of you drop back and lay for him!&#8221; ordered
Deveny. &#8220;Make it sure!&#8221; he added, after a short
pause.
</p>
<p>Barbara yielded to a quick horror. She fought
with Deveny, trying in vain to free her arms&mdash;which
he held tightly to her sides with his own. She gave
it up at last, and lay, looking up into his face, her
eyes blazing with impotent rage and repugnance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to kill him?&#8221; she charged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he laughed; &#8220;there&#8217;s no one interfering
with what&#8217;s going on now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Overcome with nausea over the conviction that
Deveny&#8217;s order meant death to Red Linton, Barbara
lay slack in Deveny&#8217;s arms for a long time. A premonitory
silence had settled over the valley; she heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
the dull thud of hoofs behind her, regular and swift,
the creaking of the saddle leather as the animal under
her loped forward.
</p>
<p>There was no other sound. For the men behind
her were strangely silent, and even Deveny seemed
to be listening.
</p>
<p>After what seemed to be a long interval, she heard
a shot, and then almost instantly, another. She shuddered,
closing her eyes, for she knew they had killed
Linton. And she had blamed Linton for guarding
her from&mdash;from the very thing that had happened
to her. And Linton had given his life for her!
</p>
<p>How long she had her eyes closed she did not know.
The time could not have been more than a few minutes
though, for she heard a voice behind her saying
to Deveny:
</p>
<p>&#8220;They got him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she looked up, to see Deveny grinning at her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re headin&#8217; for
the Cache&mdash;my hang-out. If you&#8217;d have been good
over in Lamo, the day that damned Harlan came, this
wouldn&#8217;t have happened. I&#8217;d sent for a parson, an&#8217;
I intended to give you a square deal. But now it&#8217;s
different. Then I was scared of running foul of Haydon&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t want to make trouble. But I&#8217;m running
my own game now&mdash;Haydon and me have
agreed to call it quits. Me not liking the idea of Haydon
adopting Harlan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She stared up at him, her eyes widening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Haydon were&mdash;what do you mean?&#8221;
she asked, her heart seeming to be a dead weight in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
her breast, heavy with suspicion over the dread significance
in his voice and words. She watched him,
breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m meaning that Haydon and me were running
things in the valley&mdash;that we were partners, splitting
equal. But I&#8217;m playing a lone hand now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He seemed to enjoy her astonishment&mdash;the light
in her eyes which showed that comprehension,
freighted with hopelessness, was stealing over her.
</p>
<p>He grinned hugely as he watched her face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haydon is the guy we called &#8216;Chief,&#8217;&#8221; he said,
enjoying her further amazement and noting the sudden
paleness that swept over her face. &#8220;He&#8217;s the guy
who killed your father at Sentinel Rock. He was
after you, meaning to make a fool of you. Hurts&mdash;does
it?&#8221; he jeered, when he saw her eyes glow with a
rage that he could understand. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of that
chain deal&mdash;Haydon was telling me. When he shot
your father he lost a bit of chain. Harlan found it
and gave it back to him, with you looking on. I
reckon that&#8217;s why him and Harlan hit it off together
so well&mdash;Harlan knowing he killed your father and
not telling you about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The long shudder that shook the girl betrayed
something of the terrible emotion under which she was
laboring; and when she finally opened her eyes to gaze
again into Deveny&#8217;s, they were filled with a haunting
hopelessness&mdash;a complete surrender to the sinister circumstances
which seemed to have surrounded her from
the beginning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan,&#8221; she said weakly, as though upon him
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
she had pinned her last hope; &#8220;Harlan has joined you
after all&mdash;he is against me&mdash;too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Him and Haydon are after the Rancho Seco.
Harlan&#8217;s been playing with Haydon right along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Barbara said nothing more. She was incapable of
coherent thought or of definite action&mdash;or even of
knowledge of her surroundings.
</p>
<p>For it seemed to her that Deveny had spoken truthfully.
She had seen the incident of the broken chain;
she had seen Harlan&#8217;s hypocritical grin upon that occasion&mdash;how
he had seemed to be eager to ingratiate
himself with Haydon.
</p>
<p>All were against her&mdash;everybody. Everybody, it
seemed, but Red Linton. And they had killed Linton.
</p>
<p>She seemed to be drifting off into a place which was
peopled with demons that schemed and planned for
her honor and her life; and not one of them who
planned and schemed against her gave the slightest
indication of mercy or manliness. The world became
chaotic with swirling objects&mdash;then a blank, aching
void into which she drifted, feeling nothing, seeing
nothing.

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE ULTIMATE TREACHERY</h3>
</div>

<p>When Barbara regained consciousness she was
lying in some long, dusty grass beside the trail
where she seemed to have been thrown, or where she
had fallen. For she was lying on her right side, her
right arm doubled under her, and she felt a pain in her
shoulder which must have been where she had struck
when she had fallen.
</p>
<p>She twisted around and sat up, bewildered, almost
succumbing to the hideous terror which instantly
gripped her when she remembered what had happened.
</p>
<p>Deveny&#8217;s horse stood near her, nipping the tips of
the grass that grew at her feet. Beyond the animal&mdash;a
little to her right, and perhaps fifty feet from her&mdash;were
other horses, with riders.
</p>
<p>As she staggered to her feet she recognized the
men who had been with Deveny. They were on their
horses&mdash;all facing away from her. Facing Deveny&#8217;s
men were all the T Down boys&mdash;she recognized them
instantly. Pistols glittered in their hands; they seemed
to be in the grip of some strong passion, which
wreathed their faces into grim, bitter lines.
</p>
<p>Near the T Down men&mdash;flanking them&mdash;were
other men. Among them she saw faces she knew&mdash;Colver,
Strom Rogers, and others.
</p>
<p>There must have been twenty-five or thirty men,
altogether, and they were all on a little level beside
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
the trail. It seemed to Barbara that they all appeared
to have forgotten her; seemed not to know that she
was in the vicinity.
</p>
<p>She saw Deveny standing on the little level. His
profile was toward her; there was a wild, savage glare
in his eyes.
</p>
<p>Not more than a dozen feet from him was Harlan.
</p>
<p>She saw Harlan&#8217;s face from the side also. There
was a grin on his lips&mdash;bitter, mirthless, terrible.
</p>
<p>She stood for what seemed to her a long time, watching
all of them; her heart throbbing with a dread heaviness
that threatened to choke her; her body in a state
of icy paralysis.
</p>
<p>She thought she knew what had happened, for it
seemed to her that everything in the world&mdash;all the
passions and the desires of men&mdash;centered upon her.
She felt that there were two factions&mdash;one headed
by Deveny, and the other by Harlan, representing
Haydon&mdash;and that they were about to fight for her.
The T Down men seemed to be standing with Harlan&mdash;as,
of course, they would, since he had sent for them
to come to the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>Oddly, though, they apparently seemed to pay no
attention to her; not one of them looked at her.
</p>
<p>If they were to fight it made no difference to her
which faction won, for her fate would be the same, if
she stayed.
</p>
<p>She did not know what put the thought into her
mind, but as she stood there watching the men she
repeated mentally over and over the words: &#8220;If I
stay.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>Why should she stay? She answered the question
by stealing toward Deveny&#8217;s horse. When she
reached the animal she paused, glancing apprehensively
at the men, her breathing suspended&mdash;hoping, dreading,
her nerves and muscles taut. It seemed they must
see her.
</p>
<p>Not a man moved as she climbed upon the back of
the horse; it seemed to her as she urged the animal
gently and slowly away from the men that they heard
nothing and saw nothing but Harlan and Deveny, and
that Harlan and Deveny saw nothing but each other.
</p>
<p>She sent the horse away, walking him for a dozen
yards or more, until he crossed the little level and sank
into a shallow depression in the trail. Still looking
back, she saw that none of the men had changed
position&mdash;that they seemed to be more intent upon
Harlan and Deveny. And she could hear Harlan&#8217;s
voice, now, low, husky.
</p>
<p>She urged the horse into a lope; and when she had
ridden perhaps a hundred yards, the conviction that
she would escape grew strong in her. Once out of the
valley she would ride straight to Lamo, to ask Sheriff
Gage to protect her.
</p>
<p>She rode faster as she widened the distance that
separated her from the men; and soon the horse was
covering the trail rapidly; and she leaned forward in
the saddle, praying that the men might not see her.
</p>
<p>She had gone several miles when she noticed a dark
object beside the trail ahead of her. She drew the
horse down and approached the spot cautiously. And
when she saw that the object was a man, her thoughts
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
flew to the shot she had heard, and to Deveny&#8217;s
words:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make sure of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> Linton, she saw, as she halted the horse near
the object she had seen. He was lying on his right
side, resting his weight on an elbow, as though trying
to rise.
</p>
<p>In an instant she was out of the saddle and at his
side, raising his head.
</p>
<p>He looked at her, smiled, and said weakly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got away, eh? I reckon they met Harlan.
I was hopin&#8217; they would. Did they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered quickly. She had seen that
Linton was badly wounded, and she knew that she
must give up hope of getting to Lamo in order to give
him the care he needed.
</p>
<p>So without speaking further, though with an effort
that required the last ounce of her strength, she lifted
Linton, he helping a little, and led him toward her
horse. Somehow, with Linton doing all he could, she
got him into the saddle, climbed up behind him, and
sent the horse toward the Rancho Seco.
</p>
<p>Back at the little level where the men were grouped
there was a tension that seemed to charge the atmosphere
with tragedy. Deveny&#8217;s men sat silent in
their saddles, watching their leader and Harlan with
sullen, savage eyes. The T Down men, facing them,
were equally sullen. Guns in hand, they alertly
watched the men who were with Deveny, plainly determined
that there should be no interference from them
in the tragedy that seemed imminent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>Rogers and his men, and the riders who had come
with Colver, were also watching the Deveny group.
All of these held weapons, too; and Rogers, who had
dismounted, was standing beside his horse, a rifle resting
on the saddle seat, his cheek snuggling the stock,
the muzzle trained on Deveny.
</p>
<p>Harlan, Rogers, and the others, racing down the
valley, had met Deveny and his men coming up. And
when Deveny had recognized Harlan and the others
he had quickly dismounted, bearing his unconscious
burden. Because he felt that trouble would result
from the meeting, Deveny had thrown Barbara from
him.
</p>
<p>He had instantly forgotten the girl. For when
Harlan came up Deveny saw a gleam in his eyes that
sent his brain to throbbing with those unmistakable
impulses of fear which had seized him the day, in
Lamo, when Harlan had faced him.
</p>
<p>There had been a moment of silence when the two
groups met; a stiffening of muscles and the heavy,
strained breathing that, in men, tells of mental preparation
for violence, swift and deadly.
</p>
<p>It had been Harlan who had prevented concerted
action&mdash;action that would have brought about a battle
in which all would have figured. His guns came out
before the thought of trouble could definitely form in
the brains of the Deveny men; and he had held them&mdash;the
men in the saddles, Deveny standing&mdash;until the
T Down men, whom he had seen from a distance, coming
toward him, could arrive.
</p>
<p>Then, still menacing the Deveny men with weapons,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
he had dismounted to face Deveny&mdash;where he had
been when Barbara Morgan had recovered consciousness.
</p>
<p>And while the girl had been stealing away he had
been talking to Deveny, though loud enough for all of
them to hear.
</p>
<p>There was about Harlan as this moment a threat
that brought awe into the hearts of Deveny&#8217;s men&mdash;a
cold, savage alertness that told them, unmistakably,
that the man&#8217;s rage was at a pitch where the slightest
movement by any of them would precipitate that action
for which, plainly, Harlan longed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you got Barbara Morgan?&#8221; he said as he stood
close to Deveny. There was a taunt in his voice, and
an irony that made Deveny squirm with fury.
</p>
<p>And yet Deveny fought hard for composure. He
could see in Harlan&#8217;s manner something akin to what
he had seen that day, in Lamo, when Harlan had
baited him. His manner was the same, yet somehow
it was not the same. There was this difference:
</p>
<p>In Lamo, Harlan had betrayed the threat of
violence that Deveny had felt. But he had seemed to
be composed, saturnine&mdash;willing to wait. It had
seemed, then, that he wanted trouble, but he would
not force it.
</p>
<p>Now, he plainly intended to bring a clash quickly.
The determination was in his eyes, in the set of his
head, and in his straight, stiff lips.
</p>
<p>He seemed to have forgotten the other men; his
gaze was on Deveny with a boring intensity that sent
a chill of stealthy dread over the outlaw.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>Deveny had faced many men in whose hearts lurked
the lust to kill; he had shot down men who had faced
him with that lust in their eyes&mdash;and he knew the passion
when he saw it.
</p>
<p>He saw it now, in Harlan&#8217;s eyes&mdash;they were wanton&mdash;in
them was concentrated all the hate and contempt
that Harlan felt for him. But back of it all
was that iron self-control that Deveny had seen in the
man when he had faced him in Lamo.
</p>
<p>Deveny had avoided Harlan since that day. He
had known why&mdash;and he knew at this minute. It
was because he was afraid of Harlan&mdash;he feared him
as a coward fears the death that confronts him. The
sensation was premonitory. Nor was it that. It <i>had</i>
been premonitory&mdash;it was now a conviction. In the
time, in Lamo, when he had faced Harlan some prescience
had warned him that before him was the man
whom the fates had selected to bring death to him.
</p>
<p>He had felt it during all the days of Harlan&#8217;s
presence in the section; he had felt it, and he had
avoided the man. He felt it now, and his breathing
grew fast and difficult&mdash;his chest laboring as he
shrilled breath into his lungs.
</p>
<p>He knew what was coming; he knew that presently
Harlan&#8217;s passion would reach the point where action
would be imperative; that presently would come that
slow, halting movement of Harlan&#8217;s hands toward his
gun&mdash;which gun? He would witness, with himself
as one of the chief actors, the hesitating movement
which had brought fame of a dread kind to the man
who stood before him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>Could he beat Harlan to the &#8220;draw?&#8221; Could he?
That question was dinned into his ears and into his
consciousness by his brain and his heart. He heard
nothing of what was going on around him; he did not
hear Harlan&#8217;s voice, though he saw the man&#8217;s lips
moving. He did not see any of the men who stood
near, nor did he see his men, sitting in their saddles,
watching him.
</p>
<p>He saw nothing but Harlan; felt nothing except the
blood that throbbed in his temples; was conscious of
nothing but the question that filled his heart, his brain,
and his soul&mdash;could he beat Harlan to the &#8220;draw?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Presently, when he saw, with astonishment, that
Harlan was slowly backing away from him, crouching
a little, he divined vaguely that the moment had come.
And now, curiously, he heard Harlan&#8217;s voice&mdash;low,
distinct, even. What an iceberg the man was!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Haydon&#8217;s dead,&#8221; he heard Harlan saying&mdash;and
he stared at Harlan, finding it difficult to comprehend.
&#8220;Lafe Woodward killed him,&#8221; Harlan went
on &#8220;killed him at the Cache. Now get this straight&mdash;all
of you.&#8221; It seemed strange to Deveny that
Harlan seemed to be speaking to the men, while
watching him, only.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woodward was killed, too. His real name was
Bill Morgan. He was Lane Morgan&#8217;s son. Bill
Morgan was sent here by the governor, to get evidence
against Haydon. He got it. I took it from his
pockets when I planted him&mdash;an&#8217; it&#8217;s goin&#8217; straight
to the governor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys are through here&mdash;&#8221; again he seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
to speak to all the men. &#8220;Morgan told me he had
some men with the Cache gang. They&#8217;re to ride out
an&#8217; join my boys&mdash;the T Down outfit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Deveny was conscious that several men detached
themselves from the group of riders he had brought
with him, and rode to where the T Down men were
standing. Then Harlan spoke again:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, she shapes up like this. If there&#8217;s any of
the Star gang wantin&#8217; to go straight, they can throw in
with the T Down boys, too. If there&#8217;s some that
figure on pullin&#8217; their freight out of the valley&mdash;an&#8217;
stayin&#8217; out&mdash;they can hit the breeze right now&mdash;drivin&#8217;
that Star herd to Willow&#8217;s Wells, sellin&#8217; them,
an&#8217; dividin&#8217; the money. Whoever is takin&#8217; up that
proposition is startin&#8217; right now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>About half the Star men began to move; heading
up the valley. There was a momentary pause, and
then those that were left of Deveny&#8217;s men moved
uneasily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that go for us guys too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wide open,&#8221; announced Harlan, cold humor
seeming to creep into his voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s your chance
to get out of this deal without gettin&#8217; what&#8217;s comin&#8217;
to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a rush and clatter as Deveny&#8217;s men
joined the men of the Star, who were already on the
move. And then there followed a long silence, during
which Deveny glanced up the valley and saw the
men riding away.
</p>
<p>He turned again, to face Harlan, with the consciousness
that he stood alone. The T Down men, half of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
the Star men, and a large proportion of the Cache
men were standing with Harlan. Deveny saw Colver
and Rogers among those who had aligned themselves
with Harlan.
</p>
<p>No invitation to withdraw had been extended to
Deveny. The knowledge strengthened his conviction
that Harlan intended to kill him. And yet, now, facing
Harlan, he knew that he would never take up
the slender thread of chance that was offered him&mdash;to
draw his gun, kill Harlan and resume his authority
over the men who were left.
</p>
<p>The possibility, dangling at the other end of the
slender thread of chance, did not allure him. For he
knew he could not draw the pistol at his hip with Harlan&#8217;s
gaze upon him&mdash;that would be suicide.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deveny!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s voice, snapping with menace roused him,
straightened him, brought an ashen pallor to his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your turn, Deveny. You stay here. Flash
your gun!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here it was&mdash;the dreaded moment. Deveny saw
the men around him stiffen rigidly; he heard their
slow-drawn breaths. The thought to draw his gun
was strong in him, and he fought hard to force his
recreant muscles to do the will of his mind. For an
instant he stood, his right hand poised above the holster
of his pistol, the elbow crooked, ready to
straighten.
</p>
<p>And then, with the steady, coldly flaming eyes of
Harlan upon him, Harlan&#8217;s right hand extended
slightly, the fingers spread a little as though he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
about to offer his hand to the other. Deveny became
aware that he was doing an astonishing thing. He
was raising his right hand!
</p>
<p>Already it was at his shoulder. And as he marveled,
it went higher, finally coming to a level with his
head, where it stopped. He had publicly advertised
his refusal to settle his differences with Harlan with
the pistol.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yellow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Harlan&#8217;s voice. &#8220;You won&#8217;t fight an&#8217; you
won&#8217;t run. Well, we&#8217;ll keep you, savin&#8217; you for the
governor. I reckon he&#8217;ll be glad to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Harlan turned, sheathing his pistol, and began to
walk toward his horse, his back toward Deveny.
</p>
<p>Then Deveny acted. His eyes flaming hate, he
drew his pistol with a flashing movement, his face
hideous with malignant passion.
</p>
<p>He sent one bullet into Harlan&#8217;s back and two more
as Harlan tumbled forward, sinking to his knees from
the shock. But Deveny&#8217;s two last bullets went wild,
tearing up the grass of the level as the gun loosened in
his hand.
</p>
<p>For Rogers&#8217; rifle was spitting fire and smoke with
venomous rapidity, and Deveny was sinking, his knees
doubling under him, his body shuddering with the impact
of each bullet.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>PEACE&mdash;AND A SUNSET</h3>
</div>

<p>Red Linton had recovered&mdash;there was no
doubt of that. For Linton, though a trifle pale,
was vigorous. Vigor was in the look of him as he
stood, a slow grin on his face, beside Barbara Morgan
at the entrance of the <i>patio</i> of the Rancho Seco ranchhouse.
</p>
<p>Barbara was sitting on a bench that ranged the
front wall of the building. She was arrayed in a
dress of some soft, fluffy material, in which she made
a picture that brought a breathless longing into Linton&#8217;s
heart&mdash;a longing which made him feel strangely
tender and sympathetic.
</p>
<p>But Barbara was not smiling. There was a wistfulness
in her eyes that made Linton gulp with jealous
thoughts that came to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t deserve it, the durned scalawag!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Deserve what?&#8221; questioned Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; muttered Linton, with an embarrassed grin.
&#8220;Shucks, I wasn&#8217;t thinkin&#8217; I was talkin&#8217; out loud.
I&#8217;m sure gettin&#8217; locoed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t deserve me?&#8221; asked Barbara.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan!&#8221; declared Linton, with a subtle glance
at the girl. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t in no ways fit to be thinkin&#8217;
serious thoughts about a girl like you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he been thinking serious thoughts?&#8221; Her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
eyes dropped from Linton&#8217;s and the latter grinned
widely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinkin&#8217; them! He&#8217;s been talkin&#8217; them. Talked
them all the time him an&#8217; me was stretched out in the
big room, gettin&#8217; over our scratches. That man is
plumb locoed. I couldn&#8217;t get him to talk nothin&#8217; else.
When I told him about the governor sendin&#8217; him congratulations,
an&#8217; offerin&#8217; to do somethin&#8217; handsome
for him, he says: &#8216;You say she ain&#8217;t worryin&#8217; none
about things? Red, do you think she&#8217;d hook up with
a guy like me&mdash;that&#8217;s got a bad reputation?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Linton shot a side glance at Barbara and saw a
flush steal into her cheeks. He concealed a broad grin
with the palm of his hand and then said, gruffly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I answers him as such a impertinent question ought
to be answered. Says I&mdash;&#8216;Harlan, you&#8217;re a damned
fool!&#8217;&mdash;askin&#8217; your pardon, ma&#8217;am. A girl like Barbara
Morgan ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to throw herself away on a no-good
outlaw. Not none! Why, ma&#8217;am, he&#8217;s an outlaw
at heart as well as by reputation. He&#8217;s clean bad&mdash;there
ain&#8217;t a bit of good in him. Didn&#8217;t he go to
Haydon deliberate? An&#8217; didn&#8217;t he keep you in suspense
about what was goin&#8217; on&mdash;not tellin&#8217; you anything
until he had to? Shucks!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there was a method in that, Linton,&#8221; said
Barbara; &#8220;he told me he was afraid I&#8217;d unconsciously
betray him, and then he could not have done what he
did.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Linton grinned again&mdash;again concealing the grin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that you believe the cuss
done the best he could?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I do, Linton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks. Women is odd that way, ain&#8217;t they?
You ain&#8217;t tellin&#8217; me that you think he&#8217;s on the level&mdash;that
his reputation ain&#8217;t as bad as some folks make
believe it is, an&#8217; that he&#8217;s <i>square</i>?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he&#8217;s square, Linton!&#8221; the girl answered,
firmly.
</p>
<p>Linton was silent for an instant, during which he
stood on one foot, looking westward where the sun
was swimming low above the big valley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said lowly, breaking the silence:
&#8220;I&#8217;m damned if I ain&#8217;t beginnin&#8217; to believe it, myself.
There&#8217;s some things that seem to prove it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;First, there&#8217;s him takin&#8217; your part over in Lamo.
Then there&#8217;s him comin&#8217; here with you, knowin&#8217; you
was alone&mdash;an&#8217; not botherin&#8217; you. Then he guarded
you right steady, not lettin&#8217; Haydon or Deveny run in
on you. Then he makes me foreman&mdash;which seems
to prove that he&#8217;s got sense. Then he goes up the
valley an&#8217; helps your brother bust up the outlaw gang,
riskin&#8217; his life a lot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; all the time he knows where your dad hid that
gold. But he didn&#8217;t touch it until he got over that
scratch Deveny give him&mdash;or until he could take you
where it was hid an&#8217; show you he hadn&#8217;t touched it.
Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he added with a hyprocritical grin&mdash;which
he did not permit the girl to see&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m beginnin&#8217;
to believe the cuss is on the level.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he <i>is</i>, Linton!&#8221; said Barbara, in a low, earnest
voice.
</p>
<p>Again there was a silence. Then&mdash;&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;s a pretty good looker, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is handsome!&#8221; Again the girl blushed.
</p>
<p>And again Linton grinned. He cleared his throat
before he again spoke:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he drawled; &#8220;mebbe I wouldn&#8217;t go that
far. Mostly I don&#8217;t care for a handsome man, anyway.
I wouldn&#8217;t say he&#8217;s ugly, an&#8217; I won&#8217;t say he&#8217;s
handsome. I&#8217;d light on a spot about halfway between
them two extremes. I&#8217;d say he ain&#8217;t a bad looker.
That would be about right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>is</i> handsome, Linton!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, likely he is&mdash;to a woman. I&#8217;ve heard
that there&#8217;s <i>been</i> women which thought him a heap
good lookin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where, Linton?&#8221; she asked, quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, in Pardo, ma&#8217;am. There was a biscuit
shooter in a eatin&#8217;-house there that was sure wild about
Harlan&mdash;she followed him around a heap.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t have anything to do with her, Linton?&#8221;
she questioned, stiffening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! Not him. Women never bothered him
none. He always fought shy of them&mdash;until now.
He&#8217;s changed a lot. I don&#8217;t understand him no more.
Keeps a-moonin&#8217; regular about you. I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; a heap
sick of hangin&#8217; around him. Ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a heap odd, ma&#8217;am. I was thinkin&#8217;
you didn&#8217;t like him a heap. Accordin&#8217; to that, I
reckon you&#8217;d be right glad to see him&mdash;comin&#8217; home
from Pardo&mdash;where&#8217;s he been to have that gold
assayed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be here before dark, Linton. And
I shall be glad to see him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopin&#8217; the gold will assay good, I reckon?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoping he will come back, safe.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care about the gold?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only about him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Linton,&#8221; she said, gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s odd, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; drawled Linton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That I feel the same way about the cuss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked keenly at him, saw the dancing, wayward
gleam in his eyes, and gave him a reproachful glance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been pumping me, Linton,&#8221; she charged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he defended; &#8220;he&#8217;s my friend, ma&#8217;am; an&#8217;
I was sure worried, thinkin&#8217; you wouldn&#8217;t take him&mdash;if
he offered himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She smiled, wisely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did that long ago, Linton&mdash;right after he&mdash;well,
the day he got up, after the doctor told him he
could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he could offer himself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That he could get up. Linton,&#8221; she said, severely;
&#8220;you want to know too much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Linton did not answer. He took her by an arm,
raised her to her feet, and turned her face toward
the northeast&mdash;where a rider came, not more than
two or three miles distant.
</p>
<p>Linton left her to stand there, while he made his
way into one of the bunkhouses, where, with an appearance
of unconcern that he did not feel, he watched the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
coming rider. And when he saw the rider head his
horse straight for the gate of the patio, Linton grinned
widely and sought some of the other men in the cook-house.
</p>
<p>The sun was between the two huge mountains at
the western end of the big valley when Harlan dismounted
at the <i>patio</i> gate and dropped, tired and
dusty, to the bench upon which Barbara sat. Had
Linton seen what occurred when Harlan dismounted
he would have ceased to speculate over certain phases
of the relations between the man and the girl.
</p>
<p>Barbara did not seem to mind the dust on Harlan&#8217;s
sleeve, nor did she feel it on his shoulder where
her head was nestling.
</p>
<p>For both were looking out into the big valley, where
the sun was sinking with a splendor that reminded them
of another day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold isn&#8217;t worth mining,&#8221; said Harlan,
gently. &#8220;The assayer used names that didn&#8217;t mean
anything to me, but he told me enough in plain talk,
to prove that your dad wasted his time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied,&#8221; said the girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too,&#8221; smiled Harlan. &#8220;There&#8217;s somethin&#8217;
better than gold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s peace&mdash;and happiness,&#8221; said Barbara, gently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; a girl,&#8221; smiled Harlan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a man,&#8221; declared Barbara stoutly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he conceded, &#8220;we won&#8217;t quarrel.
We&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s both.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And they sat, saying little, watching the colors of
the sunset flame over the mighty valley&mdash;stealing over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
the vast, silent space that spread between the two
mountain ranges. And the big valley smiled back at
them, softening the sadness that dwelt in the heart of
the girl, and holding out to both of them a promise of
good to come&mdash;telling them of a mystery that had
been solved, and of a menace removed.
